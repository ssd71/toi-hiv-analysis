In the last five years, over 6,300 women were detected with the virus during pregnancy, underlining the urgent need to reach out to people who may be living with the virus but are unaware of their status. This World AIDS Day, as there is a global clamour for expansion of HIV-testing and treatment under the theme of ‘Know your status’, activists demanded that government agencies must push facilities deeper into the community. Dr Ashok Anand, who heads the gynaecology department at JJ Hospital, that carries out a massive volume of HIV positive childbirths, said even today, hundreds of women find out their status only during their pregnancy. “Most women get the infection from husbands. In fact, many husbands know about their HIV status only when their wives are pregnant,” said Dr Anand. Data from Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 92% of infections are due to unsafe sex, a significant percentage of which is among heterosexual couples. The remaining are caused by transfusion with infected blood, use of infected needles or from mother to child. Dr Anand said prevention was better as always, as an infected mother also stands the risk of passing on the virus to the child. While with multiple-drug regimen the incidence of mother-to-child transmission has reduced a great deal, some babies continue to get the infection from mothers. Since 2014-15, nearly 300 babies have got HIV infection from mothers in the state. Activist Ganesh Acharya said it was time to remodel targeted interventions and penetrate communities deeper. “We need more behaviour change communication to encourage more to get tested,” he said, adding that people still getting HIV in large numbers suggest that programmes may be failing. Maharashtra State Aids Control Organisation (MDACS) officials said a decade ago more than 4,000 pregnant women tested positive every year. “The number of women testing positive declined by 85% over 10 years, even as women being screened more than doubled,” said a senior official. He said from nearly 8 lakh in 2008, over 21 lakh pregnant women were now being screened annually in Maharashtra. MDACS assistant project director Dr Shrikala Acharya said to facilitate testing BMC has tied up with 113 outlets of Metropolis where HIV test will be carried out for Rs75 for a week from December 1."

The test will be available for a week at Rs75 almost a fifth of the usual cost at 700 laboratories of the private Metropolis laboratory from December. “We are focusing on normalising HIV testing,’’ said Dr Shrikala Acharya of MDACS ahead of World AIDS Day, whose theme is ‘Know your status’. If tests are easily available at public places for free or at affordable rates, testing may be seen as a socially accepted concept. “At present, if people are asked to undergo a test by their doctor or health worker, they will come up with an excuse or say this test is not for them as they are safe,’’ she said. There are 38,000 people with the virus who have registered with MDACS in Mumbai city, but there is no corresponding estimate for the private sector so far. MDACS will put up kiosks at CSTM, Dadar, Kurla, Andheri, Ghatkopar and Borivli stations to make the test easily accessible. Experts admit that the stigma attached to HIV and AIDS is still high, preventing people from testing themselves, leading to a delay in the start of treatment. “We want to make testing a social movement. It should be a normal question to ask each other if one has undergone the HIV test,’’ she added. MDACS will carry out social media campaigns with Marathi film and TV actors to promote HIV testing. “The idea is to create a social movement of sorts so that people forget the stigma attached to HIV testing,” she said."

Rajya Sabha passed the bill in March that criminalises discrimination against patients suffering Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) , which attacks and weakens the body’s immune system. Here is all you need to know about the act: * The bill is a milestone because it empowers a person living with HIV to report discrimination meted out against them in fields of employment, health care services, educational services, public facilities, property rights, holding public office, and insurance. * The Act penalises ""propagation of hatred"" against the protected person where a violator could be punished with a minimum jail term of three months to a maximum of two years and can be fined up to one lakh rupees. * The Act makes Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) a legal right for all HIV/AIDS patients. It has also adopted ""test and treat"" policy which means any person testing positive will be entitled for free treatment by the state and central government. Earlier, this was restricted by a CD4 count rate. * It also provides for confidentiality of HIV-related information and makes it necessary to get informed consent for undertaking HIV tests, medical treatment and research. * The law makes it mandatory for state governments to appoint an Ombudsman to inquire into complaints related to the violation of the Act and the provision of health care services. * If a person or an institution fails to comply with any order given by the Ombudsman within the stipulated period of time, they could be fined a maximum of Rs 10,000. A continuous failure could lead to an additional fine of up to Rs 5000 every day until the they comply. * The new legislation has provisions to safeguard the property rights of HIV positive people. Every HIV infected person below the age of 18 years has the right to reside in a shared household and enjoy the facilities of the household. * The Bill was initially introduced in Parliament by the UPA government, the amendments to the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2014 were revived by the Narendra Modi government in July last year. * The total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated at 21.17 lakhs, whereas around 86000 new HIV infections were reported in 2015, showing 66% decline in new infections from 2000. In 2015 around 68000 people died of AIDS-related causes nationally. Read this story in Bengali"

The 19-year-old boy was hospitalised on Wednesday after he consumed poison. The boy, hailing from a village near Kamuthi in Ramanathapuram had donated blood to the Sivakasi blood bank on November 30 without knowing his HIV status. The blood was used for the 23-year-old pregnant woman in the Sattur hospital on December 3 and she got infected. Madras high court asks TN govt to file report on transfusion of HIV positive blood to pregnant womanAfter he was told about his HIV status, he became depressed and consumed rat poison on Wednesday morning. He was taken to the Ramanathapuram district headquarters hospital, after he was referred from a local hospital. He was later shifted to the GRH. Doctors said he was treated in the intensive care unit, where the best possible treatment was given. Meanwhile, family members of the deceased expressed suspicion over the death. They contended that he was talking normally till the night before and died suddenly after vomiting blood. They submitted a petition to the hospital authorities demanding that the post-mortem be video-taped. They wanted doctors from other hospitals to join the forensic team at the Madurai Medical College. “We suspect foul play in the death and a thorough investigation should be conducted. We have submitted a petition with the hospital authorities. Unless the demands are met, we will not receive the body after postmortem,” a relative of his told newsmen at the GRH. Dr S Shanmugasundaram, dean (in-charge) of Madurai Medical College and GRH, told TOI that vomiting blood is a usual complication that arises after rat poison is consumed. A team of doctors was monitoring him. As soon as he vomited blood early on Sunday morning, one unit of blood and three units of frozen plasma was transfused to him. But he died at 8.10 am, not responding to the treatment, he said. The dean said the postmortem, which was planned to be conducted on Sunday, did not take place as they did not receive a requisition from the police station. The pregnant woman is undergoing anti-retroviral therapy at the GRH."

Four feet tall and with body weight of 30 kilos, she is at least 25kg underweight and significantly short for her age. Her mental ability is of a kid half her age. She is also hearing impaired. At Solapur’s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, one of Maharashtra’s oldest institutions caring for children living with HIV, cases like Sumana’s are not an exception. At least 60% of the 110 children here suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. The prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over a third have stymied mental development. Besides physical, the prevalence of mental health problems such as depression is alarmingly high. AIDS-related deaths may have dropped 54% and new infections 66% in India over a decade, but children like Sumana are testimony to the gaping deficit in the national programme that focuses on drugs instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model that a complex disease like HIV warrants. An otherwise spirited child, Sumant becomes drowsy and irritable after taking medicines. “I get severe stomach-ache, dizziness, headache and diarrhoea,” he says, describing his plight after taking the daily dose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines. The six-year-old is among the 17 children at the Palawi home who have forsaken ART even though their survival depends on it. Born with the virus, these children need to take 2-6 capsules daily. For additional infections such as tuberculosis, the pill count could run into double digits. “Children go through hell in spite of ART. There is no denying the dramatic shift in HIV care today, but what about those who got the disease at the turn of the century and have spent a lifetime taking medicines? We know little or nothing about what the virus or ART does to each child,” said Palawi’s 65-year-old founder Mangaltai Shah. She says most children in Palawi grapple with everyday health problems ranging from skin rashes, oral and vaginal yeast infections, pus accumulation in ears, hearing and vision problems to life-threatening infections like TB. “So when medicines meant to heal start giving trouble, they find it easier to discard.” Moreover, she adds, institutions like Palawi neither have adequate funds nor support from government hospitals to tackle the unique problems of each child. Sumant is supposed to receive intensive counselling from the local ART centre till his adherence improves, but Shah says the three doctors and four counsellors that cater to 300 HIV patients daily at Solapur Civil Hospital barely have the time. For nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors. Palawi was compelled to start its own school in 2014 as children are denied admission in regular ones the moment Palawi is mentioned. But it’s a blessing in disguise for these children who struggle to sit through more than one or two classes without dozing off. Palawi, which has been home to 250 HIV-positive children since 2001, has lost 40 to the disease."

However, the district health department refuted the claim saying that it has evidences to prove her wrong. Speaking to reporters in Mettur on Sunday, the woman said she was taking treatment during her first pregnancy at the Mecheri primary health centre in 2014. The doctors of the health centre had checked her health condition and collected blood from the Mettur Government Hospital’s blood bank and administered it to her during her delivery. She became pregnant for the second time in 2015 and went for treatment at the same health centre. When her blood samples were tested, the result confirmed that she was infected was HIV positive.

The woman, who gave birth to a boy on September 15, told reporters that she tested positive after she was administered two units of blood at the hospital in April. Hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P rejected the claim. As per medical records, the woman visited a primary health centre in Mangadu on March 6 when doctors confirmed her pregnancy. In April, doctors referred her to KMCH for blood transfusion after they found her haemoglobin level was low. The report of a blood test she did at a private hospital on February 12 shows HIV negative. At KMCH she was given two units of blood on April 5 and April 6, and she got discharged 10 days later. She was referred back to the hospital in August after scans showed the fetus was in “breech position” (legs down). That’s when the hospital ordered the HIV test. “Usually we assign a number along with every HIV test done. Her records did not have the number. So we repeated the test and she tested positive. We started her on medication and help her deliver a healthy baby in September,” said hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P. The woman said she was forced to remain silent as she feared that she would be ostracized by her family and friends. But she petitioned health minister C Vijaya Baskar, health secretary J Radhakrishnan and other senior administrators. “I did not receive any call from the government. When I read about how another pregnant woman acquired the infection, I decided to talk about my condition,” she said. “My husband has no infection. This hospital is the only possible source of infection,” she said. Director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe said the government ordered for an inquiry in December. “Today, the inquires revealed said the blood provided by the hospital was tested safe,” he said. The two units of blood (1962 and 2129) administered to the woman were labelled safe after they were screened on high-end equipment. While one of the blood samples were sourced from a college student, the other was a regular voluntary blood donor. “We have a machine printed copy that says the samples were safe,” said Dr Vasanthamani. “It is difficult for us to point out the infection source now,” she said. Health activists and NGOs say the state health department should do a more detailed inquiry to clear its name. “It is important for the hospitals to recall the donors for a HIV test. If they test negative, it is evident that the disease was not transfused through blood. What if the test was false negative because they were in their window period,” said Karunanidhi, who works for a positive network NGO. Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society project director K Senthil Raj said the state has not dropped its guard on blood screening. “We have a robost screening programme. At least 60% of deliveries happen in GH. There is no need for women to panic,” he said."

The state government had issued a notice saying the drug will not be available until the end of October sending HIV positive mothers into a panic. Nevirapine syrup is given to babies born from HIV positive mothers within 72 hours of birth to reduce the risk of contracting the disease from their mothers. The drug which was available at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centers was out of stock. It was not available at private organizations as well. After a 20-day delay, the city on Wednesday received its first consignment of Nevirapine syrups. The essential drug was out of stock since the beginning of September. While NGOs were pulling out all stops to get the drug, new mothers and pregnant women were left wringing their hands and worried sick for their babies. People living with HIV were also deprived of combinations of Nevirapine. Speaking to TOI, district AIDS prevention officer Dr Ravi said taking note of the urgency and complaints from NGOs in the city, the state government dispatched Nevirapine syrups for infants. “It is available at the ART centres and new mothers can avail it. Now there is adequate stock to cater to all pregnant and new mothers with HIV. Newborns are our priority,” he stated. Chandrashekar, head of the city-based NGO Anandajyothi, said that he had written several mails to the authorities and health officers seeking supply of the essential drug. “When NACO replied stating a three-month delay in the supply of Nevirapine, we were shocked. The drug is a necessity for newborns and pregnant women. The drug was available at ART centres but not in medical stores in the city. Since 20 days, people with HIV, parents of newborn would visit hospitals and go back crestfallen. New mothers were worried as it was the question of their child’s health. Despite repeated requisitions, the medicine was delayed by 20 days,” he added. According to statistics, the city currently has over a dozen HIV positive pregnant women. Nevirapine syrup is said to reduce the chances of a newborn acquiring the virus from the infected mother. It is given to babies within 24 hours of birth up till 45 days. What is Nevirapine? Nevirapine is a prescription medicine for the treatment of HIV infection in adults and children. It is said to prevent postnatal HIV infection.

As Pramod Sharma, a city-based social activist said that , ""Once we know the cost estimate, we will crowdsource for Pooja, who has been working for the cause for the past so many years."" Pooja has spent around Rs 40,000 on her tests and medicines till now. ""I have been told that my treatment will continue for another year. However, I am not looking for money but support for medicines and food for my children,"" said Pooja. She said that, ""I had been counselling many HIV positive patients and used to direct them for various grants from the government. And now, I am at the mercy of others."" From January till September this year, 442 people have tested positive for HIV in the city. Ayushyman Bharat and National Health Protection Scheme do not cover these patients. ""I was informed to inquire about this scheme, but we are not covered under this,"" said Pooja. She has three children, two of whom are also HIV-positive and under anti-retroviral therapy. ""We do not get any nutritional support and now I have no job due to my ill health,"" said Pooja. In the absence of a job Pooja is fighting a lonely battle, both against her neurological disease and the financial constraints. Meena Vij, working with the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV-AIDS, said that, ""After the PGI doctors prepare the cost for medicines and tests, we shall write to certain authorities for support."""

The aim of the event was to sensitize people from all walks of life on HIV/AIDS and motivate them to come forward and get tested to know about their HIV status while ensuring that all HIV positive cases are put on treatment. The two-day programme was inaugurated by prominent Punjabi Singers Ali Brothers and Sandeep Brar along with UT health services director Dr G Dewan and SACS project director Dr Vanita Gupta. In Chandigarh, there are around 6,303 HIV patients seeking treatment at various facilities. The global goal is to end AIDS by 2030. Towards this, a combined effort is being made to reach the target of 90:90:90 by 2020. The first '90' indicates that at least 90% of the HIV positive population should know their status so that they take treatment and ensure a long, healthy life and stop HIV transmission. To achieve the first 90, free HIV counselling and screening was provided to the visitors at Elante Mall. ""This day provides an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the cause of HIV prevention and treatment, draw attention on the global HIV epidemic, to raise awareness and remember those who have died, to show solidarity with the people living with it, and to celebrate survival and health,"" said an organiser."

The Punjab government should launch an aggressive campaign for educating the sections of society that are most vulnerable to contracting Aids. This includes truck drivers, drug addicts, sex workers, and pregnant women. For the treatment of infected people, integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) need to work in tandem with the health department of the state. The centres should stock necessary medicines for the treatment of this disease. Psychological treatment of the patients is also important and required to be done in a big way.

The results, however, shocked them. The woman was detected with HIV. Later, her husband was also detected with the same condition. The news shattered them and their difficulties seemed to have just begun. But they found a way out and were determined to live life to the fullest. Today, they live in a joint family and are well-known ‘care counsellors’ in Nashik and Malegaon. Both are trained paraprofessionals and offer a ray of hope to hundreds of others in Nashik district, who were detected with HIV. “When we were detected with HIV, we still decided to go ahead with the pregnancy and not to abort our child. We followed entire medical treatment, hoping that our child would be HIV negative. But, when my son was born, he was also detected HIV,” she recalled. Her husband had lost his job in a private company. They decided to leave their son with their family and end their lives. Just then, they got in touch with support groups for HIV positive people and found a source of living. “We got a work to stitch cloth bags and hand gloves. We started earning a bit. Gradually, we were introduced with the concept of paraprofessionals. As we were educated, we both underwent the training and started working as counsellors. Today, we are leading counsellors in Nashik district,” he said. Their families have accepted them whole heartedly and they live in a joint family. “We regularly take medicines and live a good life. When we share our story with other HIV+ people, they get inspired,” he said. Another couple like them was detected with HIV when they were expecting their first child. Their daughter does not have HIV infection. They have also dedicated their lives for creating awareness about HIV/AIDS. “It’s the mission of our lives now. God has blessed us with a healthy baby girl and it’s enough for us. We want her to become a doctor in the future,” the man said. This couple works in Nashik city and has successfully convinced many HIV+ patients to get treatment and take their medicines. “People can lead a healthy life for a long time with appropriate medical care. Anti-retroviral therapy effectively suppresses replication, if taken at the right time. Positive attitude, hopeand family support play a very important role in fight against AIDS,” he said. Both couples work with the Yash Foundation, which offers relief and rehabilitation to HIV/AIDS affected people. “We run a paraprofessional course that aims at encouraging youth to participate in tackling various social issues. This programme is implemented in partnership with colleges and includes sensitizing youth on adolescent health and HIV, life skills educations, leadership and personality development,” said Ravi Patil, director of Yash Foundation. “Awareness on health and HIV remains crucial. There are 108 wards under Nashik Municipal Corporation where we have initiated various community development programmes,” he said. Till date, the organization has covered 82 school and colleges and conducted training sessions on HIV/AIDS and social issues. RED Ribbon Clubs for disseminating information on HIV prevention and control have been set up in 17 schools and colleges in Nashik. Yash Foundation has the support of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd under its corporate social responsibility project. They organize state-level marriage gathering to introduce people living with HIV/ AIDS to each other. So far, around 412 eligible brides and grooms have enrolled themselves with the foundation."

This year, theme for World Aids Day is ‘Know Your (HIV) Status’. Dr Milind Bhrushundi of Central India Institute of Infectious Diseases and Research Nagpur, said, “We are targeting those who have not been tested. Since symptoms of HIV are dormant for over five years, many are not aware if they have HIV, and the only way for them is to get tested. We need to reach out to high risk population — most of whom are homosexuals and transgenders.” It is also worrisome to note instances of HIV is increasing in the age group of 15-24 years as people are more concerned about pregnancy than the child. Emergency contraceptive pills and the Internet have proven to be a problem. Also, there have been cases in which people on second line of drugs don’t take medications seriously. Alcoholism and drug abuse are significant factors, he added. A 90-90-90 programme by UNAIDS aims that by 2030, there should be a 90% reduction in the number of patients, 90% reduction in new cases and 90% less deaths. Targeted intervention projects to treat those at high risk are need of the hour. Former senior medical officer at ART centre of GMC stated that even today, the same four causes are responsible for HIV patients as those many years ago — unprotected sex and multiple sex partners, parent to child transmission, blood transfusion and unsterilized needles. “New technology is not yet available in government hospitals. Since HIV antigen takes about six months to develop, an anti-body test does not identify the antigen. And if the affected person donates blood within those six months, the antigen will be passed to the blood banks,” she said, adding that about 20 lakh patients have been taking medicine free of cost at GMC. “Earlier, 1000 new cases were identified every month, but they have now reduced to under 100,” she added. “Positive cases of HIV have reduced due to expansion of our units and increase in awareness. There has been a rise in people taking the test and antenatal check-up as well. We have started mobile vans and even issued bus passes for patients, apart from giving free treatment and drugs,” said Tanuja Fale, Programme Manager, District Aids Prevention and Control Unit."

Public health experts suspect unprotected sex and exchanging of needles in the 10-25 age group in the state to be the major reasons behind the spurt. While increase in cases has also been seen among the elderly, there is a drastic decline among other age groups. Tho ugh the incidence of the infection in TN, which recorded 43% of all cases in the country in 2003, has come down to less than 10% this year, it has gone up from 160 in 2015-16 to 187 in 2017-18 in the 10-19 age group. At least 99 people in the age group have tested positive between April and October this year. In the 20-25 age group, the number of cases has gone up from 432 in 2015 to 554 in 2017-18. At least 318 cases have been recorded between April and October this year. In the 60 and above age group, the numbers went up to 699 in 2017-18 from 536 cases in 2015-16.

Older methods of attracting target audience such as sex workers and truckers will not work with them. While it is important to keep a tab on conventional spots, it is equally important to use social media and dating apps to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS.” While several surveys, including those carried out by the union health ministry, have recorded significant drop in awareness about HIV/AIDS in the state, funding from the Centre, state and external agencies to AIDS control society too have fallen. This year of the 69 crore outlay, 55 crore went towards salaries. “Most of our staff have been working here for more than 15 years and the salaries have substantially increased. In addition, 13 crore was given to NGOs for various programmes,” said a senior officer at TANSACS. The number of people testing positive at the voluntary testing and counselling centres have dropped to mere 30%. “This means a majority of people are being tested positive at the tertiary care centres where they go with complaints of other diseases or complications of HIV. This also means they are not diagnosed early,” said R Madhuri, a psychologist who has been working in capacity building projects with NGOs. “It means the battle against AIDS is far from over,” she said. “We are doing all that we can to grab the attention of youth,” said Senthil Raj.

Later, they are advised to go back to their native places for further treatment as these facilities are available in all districts now. “It’s not a case of discrimination.

The patient, a Beliaghata resident, was admitted to Unit-V of the orthopaedic surgery department on October 5 after she fell down at her home. “All investigations prior to the surgery were done.

He said 16 inmates were found positive for hepatitis C virus and six were suffering from venereal disease related to sexual infections. The health department conducted the camp in association with the Jind jail administration under the supervision of CMO and two other doctors, including a lady doctor. Dr Dahiya said out of the six HIV positive cases, one was an old patient already undergoing treatment while the other five had been lodged in the jail recently. The CMO also about 40 to 50 women inmates were also screened during the camp and found to be free from any ailments. He said 300 inmates were yet to be examined by the health department. He said the HIV positive inmates would have to get their treatment card made from PGIMS, Rohtak, while the district health department would start their treatment in the jail. “Earlier, the HIV positive patients had to go to the antiretroviral (ART) centre in the PGIMS for treatment but now the district health team started providing the facility to them in Jind.

"30","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-sees-major-reductions-in-hiv-infections-un-report/articleshow/65064434.cms",2018-07-20,"UNITED India saw a major reduction in the number of new HIV infections, AIDS-related deaths and people living with HIV from 2010 to 2017 on the back of sustained and focussed efforts, according to a UN report which warned that the epidemic was growing in Pakistan. The Joint UN Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS) report titled 'Miles to go -- closing gaps, breaking barriers, righting injustices' said Asia and the Pacific regions have made strong inroads with its HIV response. Sustained and focused efforts to reach key populations have led to major reductions in HIV infections in Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam between 2010 and 2017. The report, however, warned that the global new HIV infections were not declining fast enough. It also noted that the epidemics were expanding in Pakistan and the Philippines. In India, new HIV infections dropped from 120,000 in 2010 to 88,000 in 2017, AIDS-related deaths from 160,000 to 69,000 and people living with HIV from 2,300,000 to 2,100,000 in the same time period, the report said. India has an approved social protection strategy, policy or framework that is being implemented, it said. Successive surveys in Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam also indicate that attitudes towards people living with HIV have improved creating safer working conditions for sex workers and engaging them closely in the design and implementation of programmes make a huge difference, it said. The report underscored the public health benefits of decriminalising sex work. It found that countries that had decriminalised at least some aspects of sex work have fewer sex workers living with HIV than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work. Modelling based on data from Canada, India and Kenya indicates that the decriminalisation of sex work could avert 33-46 per cent of HIV infections over the course of a decade. The report cited the example of Karnataka, where advocacy work with senior police officials, sensitisation workshops and the inclusion of HIV and human rights topics in pre-service curricula led to significant decreases in the arrest of female sex workers, especially during police raids. Before the interventions, half (50 per cent) of the 4,110 surveyed female sex workers said they had been arrested or detained at some point during police raids, that proportion shrank to 20 per cent after the interventions, the report said. Referring to the initiative sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the spread of HIV in India, the report said the Avahan programme in Karnataka and other States remained a ""sterling example"" of the impact of combining condom programming with community empowerment and structural improvements that tackle stigma, violence and unsafe working environments. UNAIDS, however, issued a stark wake-up call for nations, warning that the global response to HIV is at a precarious point. At the halfway point to the 2020 targets, the report warned that the pace of progress was not matching global ambition. ""We are sounding the alarm"", said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS. ""Entire regions are falling behind, the huge gains we made for children are not being sustained, women are still most affected, resources are still not matching political commitments and key populations continue to be ignored. All these elements are halting progress and urgently need to be addressed head-on,"" Sidibe said. Global new HIV infections have declined by just 18 per cent in the past seven years, from 2.2 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2017, the report noted. Although this is nearly half the number of new infections compared to the peak in 1996 (3.4 million), the decline is not quick enough to reach the target of fewer than 500,000 by 2020. In 2017, an estimated 36.9 million people globally were living with HIV and 21.7 million people were accessing treatment, it said. The report also shows that key populations are not being considered enough in HIV programming. Key populations and their sexual partners account for 47 per cent of the new HIV infections worldwide and 97 per cent of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia, where one third of new HIV infections are among people who inject drugs. ""The right to health for all is non-negotiable,"" said Sidibe. ""Sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, prisoners, migrants, refugees and transgender people are more affected by HIV but are still being left out from HIV programmes. More investments are needed in reaching these key populations,"" Sidibe added."

The government plans to set up these under public-private partnership (PPP) mode. As per the data of National Health Profile-2018, which was released recently, there are 26,841 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV). The state has 12 antiretroviral therapy centres where HIV infected people are given treatment. There are around 84 de-addiction centres located in different parts of the states, of which 53 are licensed private centres. While most of the government drug de-addiction centres already have integrated counselling and testing centres, the private centres are functioning without this facility. Dr Manpreet Chhatwal, additional project director of Punjab State Aids Control Society, shared that the integrated counselling and testing centres will be opened in private drug de-addiction centres under PPP mode as defined by the National Aids Control Organisation for screening of HIV patients as well as for hepatitis-C. As per the guidelines framed by the health department, proper screening will be done by the staff posted in these centres for HIV and hepatitis-C by using testing kits, which will be provided by National Aids Control Organisation and National Health Mission. The government will sign an MoU with the private de-addiction centres for which the process will be started by the Punjab State AIDS Control Society. Any person found HIV-positive will be referred to the nearest antiretroviral therapy centres for further treatment and the list will be shared with the nearest government centres by private de-addiction centres every month. Anyone suffering from hepatitis-C will be referred to district civil hospital and government medical colleges for further treatment. In cases where integrated counselling and testing centres are not available in public health institutes, the existing staff, including laboratory technician\staff nurse will be imparted training by the Punjab State Aids Control Society and civil surgeons office for the screening of patients and necessary kits will also made available. Punjab health minister Brahm Mohindra said that timely detection would help in providing the required care and treatment to people infected with HIV and hepatitis-C. “We want to ensure that the facility of counselling and testing centres are available at all drug de-addiction centres,” said Mohindra."

Organised by the HIV/AIDS Alliance India, the event, whose theme this year was ‘Born This Way’, brings together transgender advocates, international agencies and health organisations to present their perspectives, with song and dance and much good cheer. “We are the only sexual minority that is visible to the naked eye,” said Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, a prominent activist and head of the first transgender religious akhara. While hijras and transgender groups once had important roles in Indian society, they are yet to fully realise their freedoms. They are cast out of familial structures and political decision-making, leaving Tamanna Keni, 26, an activist from Thane, to rue, “We used to be the ‘mahalon ki zeenat’ (pride of the palaces) in Mughal times and the Maratha durbars had a place for us, but now we are left behind.” A survey of the National Human Rights Commission has established that 92% of the transgender community are economically marginalised. They rely on begging and sex work, and frequently face discrimination, even violence. A full 98% of transgender persons live apart from their families, so have for support their chosen gurus (‘the person your heart goes out to’, as Tamanna described the relationship) and their peers. This gives them a sense of community, but also sharpens their isolation from wider society. The Hijra Habba, in that sense, is an attempt to connect the community within itself and with others. Tuesday’s event started with a flash mob by the group Harmless Hugs. Many visitors were intrigued enough to stay and listen. “I had only heard myths, or seen hijras at ceremonies like weddings or births. I was just curious,” admitted Puneet Kumar, a 24-year-old MNC executive. He clapped enthusiastically at drag queen (also Mr Gay India 2014) Rani Kohinoor’s versions of ‘Ambar sariya’ and ‘I will survive’ almost as if responding to the emcee’s exhortation: “Iss function mein taaliyon ki kami nahi honi chahiye.” The Indian state recognises gender-variant identities in public documents, and many states like Tamil Nadu have dedicated transgender welfare programmes. The Supreme Court’s groundbreaking Nalsa judgment in 2014 made a basis for self-identified gender identity — the fact that you know the gender you identify with, irrespective of medical diagnosis, and that the law must give you your full due as a citizen. A transgender rights bill is pending in Parliament. Officials from agencies like the HIV/AIDS Alliance, National AIDS Control Organisation, USAID and UNAIDS spoke of “being in this together”. Cricketer Gautam Gambhir too expressed his support, congratulating everyone on the dilution of Section 377. Activist Gauri Sawant, one of those who had moved the Supreme Court on behalf of the transgender community, spoke of giving back to society and how one could invest care and attention on others. Sawant, who works in an initiative called ‘Nani ka Ghar’ for the children of sex workers, said her own sense of family was “Mere chele mere bachche hain”. She explained, “Motherhood is a behaviour, it doesn’t mean giving birth to a baby.” An exhibition at the event introduced visitors to the transgender community, what it means to identify as a woman or man, the behaviours one learns by wearing a bindi or holding up a false moustache. It introduced people to prominent trans persons and to cultural references like Bahuchara Mata, a patron deity of the hijra community. To walk through the space is to understand what it means to be born in the way we all are but being force-fitted into a rigid gender identity."

The letter, written by the organisation’s founder and CEO Peter Borges, states that “this is completely unbecoming, inhuman and unexpected in the healthcare setting. This will not only increase stigma and discrimination, but also deter thousands of people living with HIV from accessing treatment”. Borges said people, including those with HIV, expect from GMC healthcare services that are decent, respectful and free of prejudice and stigma.

His family and friends abandoned him. Heartbroken, Sahu started contemplating suicide. Not ready to give up on his life, Sahu approached a private hospital in Kolkata with the help of one of his friends. Another round of tests found Sahu to be perfectly healthy.

Despite repeated pleas to the chief medical superintendent (CMS), the woman was referred to a higher centre. After the woman was brought to the district hospital, tests indicated she was HIV-positive. After this, hospital staff allegedly refused to conduct the surgery. The woman and her family members pleaded to the staff, but they did not relent. “I am in unbearable pain. I requested the CMS to give me admission, but she refused. I am from a poor family and can’t afford expensive treatment,” said the woman, a resident of Nagina area in Bijnor, at the premises of the district hospital. She was taken to Meerut Medical College in critical condition and is still in labour at the time of filing of this report. “The woman is a native of Mumbai and married a Nagina man a few years ago. Her husband works in Delhi and they are financially deprived. The husband is not HIV-positive,” said a district hospital staff with access to the woman’s medical record. Hospital authorities on the other hand cited lack of adequate facilities as the reason for turning the woman away. CMS Dr Abha Verma said, “We have only one operation theatre and the mattress on which the operation is conducted needs to be destroyed after surgery on an AIDS patient. Besides, all surgical equipment also gets contaminated. The sterilisation process takes at least four days, which means the operation theatre needs to be shut down for that period. Our hospital has to conduct 7-8 deliveries per day. It is mandatory to carry out ceasarean section if the woman is HIV-positive. It is done for the safety of the newborn. Meerut Medical College was suitable for it, therefore we had to refer her there.”"

The board invited curious stares and subjected the family to humiliating questions. No sooner they found out about the board, the patient’s children decided not to dare enter the ward for fear of being discriminated at the educational institutions where they study. Other members of the family were in tears trying to fend off unwanted questions. TimesViewDiscriminating against and victimising an HIV/AIDS patient is not only condemnable, it is also criminal. This single insensitive act by the state’s premier hospital will only serve to dissuade others from seeking treatment. Under the central law that provides for stiff punishment against all actions that may lead to hostility against HIV patients, both, the person who ordered the placing of the board on the patient’s bed and implementor, must be punished. Also, the state government must immediately see to it that all staffers of GMC, medical and otherwise, are apprised about the proper ethics to be followed in treating HIV patients and the consequences in case of failure to do so.“The doctors, nurses, attendants and even those who bring food and clean the patient know about the health status. It is clearly written in all the papers appended in the treatment file too. I can’t understand why this board was put,” a close relative of the patient said. “The hospital should be helping such people who may not live for long. If they did not want us here, then they should have given us a special room or sent us away,” she said. The patient has been admitted at GMC in the past but this is the first time the family says such a board was affixed. “The staff did not think about the repercussions on the family. The ward sister was actually fixing the board near the patient’s head, but later put it at the foot of the bed. Were instructions given by the doctor to put the board? When the other patients ask the nurses about the board, won’t they reveal the health status?” she asked. “Even the few people who are coming to visit the patient will stop once they come to know about the health status. Neighbours are also coming to visit and are asking about the board. It’s a big shame for us. I’m going mad,” she said. The board was removed on Tuesday evening after a non-governmental organisation, Human Touch, working to end discrimination and provide care and support to people living with HIV raised the issue with the hospital authorities. Dean of Goa Medical College Dr Pradeep Naik said circulars were issued in the past asking the staff members to avoid any such terminology. “We have given strict instructions to all wards not to engage in any discriminatory behaviour against patients. From the preliminary report which I have received, it is not clear who put up the board. I have sought a detailed report by Wednesday. We will repeat the circular that we had issued earlier. This will never happen again,” he told TOI. “Universal precautions are necessary, but should not be displayed publicly on the patient’s bed,” CEO of Human Touch Foundation Peter Borges said. “This is not an isolated case. Such incidents will lead to more stigma and discrimination for those living with HIV. Such attitude of those working in medical space is unbecoming and will create hardships for those trying to access healthcare services in public hospitals. We will never be able to end the stigma if it exists in medical settings,” Borges said."

A website, launched at IIM-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) by Surat-based organizations Sri Rama Krishna (SRK) Group and Gujarat Sate Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GSNP+), will connect persons with HIV/AIDS across the globe. An initiative of GSNP+, the website has financial support from SRK Knowledge Foundation and technical support from IIM-A. IIM-A director Errol D’Souza said the website represented a progressive step. He said that field surveys indicate that the number of people living with HIV is higher than official estimates.Daksha Patel, the founder of GSNP+, said that about 16 lakh people live with HIV in India. “In Gujarat, 68,000 persons regularly visit ART (antiretroviral therapy) centres,” she said. “The actual number — including those taking treatment at private centres —might be higher. With the rise in longevity thanks to modern treatment, there has been an increase in demand for matrimony services. However, this matrimony service works way differently from the standard ones.” GSNP has so far organised six major meetings for prospective brides and grooms living with HIV and has been instrumental in 245 weddings in about a decade. The registered members for matrimony are about 1,900. Onerous challenges face patientsIt was Rasik Bhuva’s case that became instrumental in starting the matrimony service and eventually the website for GSNP+. “I was diagnosed with HIV soon after my engagement. I was quick to break the relationship off citing health issues,” said Bhuva. “When I started counselling HIV patients, I met a girl from Navsari and we tied the knot.” He admitted that even today many prefer not to disclose their positive status to their close family members. “We have made it a norm to at least involve one senior family member from both sides to avoid any trouble later,” he said. “The problem is more acute in rural areas where we go to the patient’s home as bank or government officials to administer medicines.”"

Every once a month, the person must seek leave from the workplace, arrive early in the morning to a hospital, beat the crowds and queue up for hours to collect the antiretroviral medicines. For a section of people living with HIV, this situation will soon change. In a first, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has decided to give patients the medicine stock for 90-days at a time. Currently, most patients are handed stocks for a month, and in rare instances, for two months. People living with HIV have long wanted this option, which has been tried with success in several African countries. Termed as Differentiated Service Delivery Model (DSDM), it has already been rolled out at ten centres across the country, including KEM Hospital in Parel. Patients, though, will have to meet several criteria to be eligible for DSDM. “Primarily, it will be given to those who have been on treatment for at least a year and have 95% adherence rate. The individual has to be clinically fit and free of any side-effects and opportunistic infections (such as tuberculosis) at the time of enrolment,” said Dr RS Gupta, deputy director, NACO. “Besides making it easier for patients, it will also help to decongest the ART centres,” he added. At KEM, over 500 patients have already been identified and enrolled into the programme. The Parel hospital caters to over 1500 people living with HIV. “Patients often have problems seeking frequent leaves from their workplace. This initiative will save them repeated visits only for drug refill. It will also save travel costs,” said Dr Srikala Acharya, assistant project director at the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS). She added that only patients on the first line of treatment and CD4 count (a vital parameter) of more than 500 will be considered for DSDM. Besides Mumbai’s KEM, centres at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Benaras, and designated hospitals in Manipur, Bhagalpur and Raipur are rolling out the initiative. Talking to TOI, a person living with HIV hailed the model and said it was long-awaited and will go a long way in making life easy for patients. “Most HIV-affected people continue to live in anonymity. It, therefore, becomes difficult to explain in offices why one needs to leave every month on fixed days,” said the 42-year-old central Mumbai resident. Members of the civil society too have welcomed the decision but cautioned that support systems have to be strengthened for the model to succeed. “It’s a great initiative particularly for patients who have to visit resource-strapped health facilities. In Mumbai, 17 ART centres cater to nearly 35000 patients. Decongestion of these centres will allow counsellors to spend more time with patients,” said HIV activist Ganesh Acharya. However, he said for DSDM to succeed, counselling facilities must be enhanced. Echoing the same, Sachin Awasthi from Vihaan, a patients’ group that works towards improving adherence, said that the monthly meeting with counsellors and caregivers play an important role. “We have to ensure that patients don’t start taking their regimes casually,” he said."

Some raised objections against its provisions saying that it was not survivor-centric, while others claimed that it was quite comprehensive. “The bill creates a new offence known as ‘aggravated trafficking’, which attracts 10 years in prison that may extend to life imprisonment. This is in addition to the existing definition of trafficking under IPC Section 370. However, the logical fallacy of this gradation is evident when it lists trafficking (for begging) as an ‘aggravated offence’, whereas trafficking for sexual exploitation is a general offence. We need a legislation that harmonizes various provisions to end trafficking,” said MP Shashi Tharoor. He added Centre had promised a comprehensive legislation before the Supreme Court in 2015 in the Prajwala case. “The bill only adds to the existing, overlapping cocktail of laws. Through the creation of 10 antitrafficking bodies, it will create more confusion in enforcing laws,” said the MP. He added that Clause 16 of the bill – which allows medical examination of survivors – fails to mention that consent of survivors will be taken as and when practicable. This is relevant as there might be people with HIV/ AIDS among survivors and there have been instances where their medical results have been shared with courts without consent. Courts have unfortunately ruled that such persons must remain in rehab homes as their families are unable to take care of them, he said. Activist Sunitha Krishnan – who took efforts to create the bill’s initial draft – said: “Of the 14 chapters in the bill, six focuses on survivors – including their rescue, protection, compensation, relief and rehab. It is the most survivor-centric and gender-neutral bill focused on ending trafficking,” she said. Former member of Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights advocate J Sandhya said the bill seeks multiple level systems (national, state, district and local) to prevent trafficking. If more committees are involved, it would be less effective in checking crime. “On the compensation fund, it seems to be creating another parallel programme. No funds are offered in the existing compensation fund. Sexual violence and protection of survivors must be handled in totality,” she said. Tharoor added that a sum of Rs 10 crore will be allotted by the Centre to the rehab fund whereas the present central government has spent Rs 4,343 crore on publicity since May 2014. This is a bill drafted by the bureaucracy for the bureaucracy, he said."

On Friday, the woman met media persons and claimed that she learnt she was pregnant in December 2017. She was initially getting treatment at a primary health centre in Mangadu and subsequently, got blood tests, including that for HIV, done at a private hospital and the results showed that she was HIV negative. Her haemoglobin count, however, was found to be low and she was referred by the PHC to undergo blood transfusion at KMCH, she said. The woman underwent treatment at the hospital for around ten days and was discharged once haemoglobin levels improved. A few months later, she went for check up at KMCH and was found to be HIV positive, she said. The woman has alleged that she got the HIV infection after undergoing blood transfusion at KMCH and has accused the hospital’s negligence for her plight. The woman and her husband are vegetable vendors. The couple levelled allegations against the staff at the KMCH. “We are sure that we contracted the virus from the hospital, since we have results from an earlier test that show my wife didn’t have the infection,” the woman’s husband said. When we questioned KMCH staff after she tested positive post transfusion, they told there was not much that could be done now since she has contracted the infection. They argued that they were not responsible for her condition. Some of the staff members even told us that we won’t be able to fight the case in court since we did not have the monetary backing to do so,” he added. The woman who gave birth to a boy on September 15, said she was administered two units of blood at KMCH in April. The KMCH authorities said there seemed to have been some irregularities with the initial HIV screening done at private labs.

As per the proposal, NMC will issue free smart card pass — that will be renewable every year — for Red bus service for those who can’t afford to travel to ART centres. The beneficiaries can travel in NMC buses six times a month using the pass. After sending the list of registered persons to the transport department, the free pass or smart card will be submitted to respective district collector, and district AIDS prevention and control squad, Nagpur. After getting administrative approval for the proposal, the transport committee and NMC will prepare a policy on this. The transport department has also submitted income and expenditure statements for three months (April-June) of this current fiscal.

As part of the national initiative, the state government in September had launched detection survey- HIV and TB Intervention in Prisons and other closed settings in Tamil Nadu - for people who fall under vulnerable groups for the two diseases. The detection drive started in Trichy on November 19 and got over on December 1. A total of 1,760 people were covered in the drive including 1,195 from the Trichy central prison and special prison for women and 565 people from orphanages, rescue and rehabilitation shelters and old-age homes, that were zeroed in for the programme. Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri told TOI that all people with symptoms of tuberculosis were tested during the programme. A total of 115 sputum samples were collected. “We utilised this opportunity to cover the vulnerable groups and no one tested positive for TB. Early intervention is an absolute must for efficient treatment of TB,” she said. Though there were no new TB cases at the prisons, there were a handful of existing TB patients and they were being provided treatment. No existing TB cases were reported in other closed settings and state-run homes. While less prevalence of TB among people detected recently might seem to be positive news, according to health officials, prevalence is still high in Trichy city, Manachanallur, Thuvakudi and Thiruverumbur. So far, this year around 2,800 people were said to have received treatment for treatment in the whole district. On the other hand, all adults among the covered population were made to undergo the HIV/AIDS test. “Unlike TB, HIV/ AIDS does not show early symptoms. In some cases, it may take seven to ten years for symptoms to show. That’s why all the adults were tested,” District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), S Martin Manivannan said. Though there were no new cases, around seven to 10 HIV/ AIDS patients were inmates at the prisons and none in the other closed settings. Manivannan said that no positive HIV/ AIDS cases was evidence for how much the disease has decreased in Trichy. “Compared to the prevalence rate of 1.91% in 2011, the prevalence is just 0.37% now. Detection drives like the recent ones show how much AIDS has been curbed in the district,” he said."

Referring to a recent report on the Nipah virus outbreak in May-June which differed on the number of deaths due to the infection from the official toll, the minister said there was no confusion. “Kerala was the only state which successfully defended the outbreak. Those who have read the medical report on Nipah would clearly understand that statistics presented by the government was accurate.” As per the official records, there are only 18 confirmed cases including the index case and 16 deaths. Recently, there was a confusion on the toll following the publication of a research paper in an international journal which also included four probable cases which were not confirmed by tests. Shailaja praised the efforts of the health department who successfully found the virus by the time the second death was reported. “We identified the virus and initiated effective countermeasures which proved vital in controlling the outbreak. Patients who showed identical symptoms to the deceased were checked and their blood samples collected. Of the 18, who showed similar symptoms initially, 16 died but we were able to save two people.” She further added that there was no point in saying that sending samples prior to confirming the disease would have made significant changes. “Even the sample taken from a person, who lost four members to the virus, showed negative. So, saying things would’ve been different if we had sent in the samples earlier is pointless,” she argued. MLA V S Sivakumar presided over the ceremony.

An official said the centre is facing a major challenge with follow-ups as many avoid the therapy fearing side effects while many others feel that there is no need to take the treatment continuously when they are fit. The biggest fallout of this is that when patients finally turn up with opportunist infections, it is too late to do anything for them. “They come to us and beg to be saved from dying. At that stage, we are really helpless,” he said. At the centre, patients on therapy are counselled to continue with the treatment regime, as non-adherence has high chances of them developing resistance to drugs. An official said that while drug resistance can occur even among patients, who have been on ART for a long period, skipping the therapy without a consultant’s advice will also do no good. The ART centre has about 200 cases of first-line failure and about 15 cases of secondline failure. He said when a patient develops resistance to drugs, it complicates matters even for the doctor, adding some patients simply disappear after starting the therapy. “To avoid follow-up, they do everything possible to stay away. They change their contact numbers and even residence,” he said. The centre’s staff has now stopped tracing such patients following a directive of the National AIDS Control Organisation. A positive development for the centre is that it no longer needs to send blood samples to JJ Hospital for detecting a viral load of HIV/ AIDs persons. They get samples tested at an independent laboratory in Mumbai and results are received on mail the very next day, while a hard copy is received within a month. This, he said is a major relief for patients developing drug resistance as drugs can be altered without much delay. In the past, he said persons failing to respond to ART had to visit the Mumbai centre to get their drugs but now they can avail it here except those who are on thirdline regime."

Meanwhile, citing how few donors came to know that they were infected with certain diseases through blood test, Trichy programme manager of District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Dr S Martin Manivannan said that blood donation offers the general public a chance to know about their general health."

A vacation bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice P T Asha directed the Tamil Nadu health secretary to file a status report on the incident and actions taken. The report should be filed by January 3. On Thursday, when the vacation bench commenced its proceedings, advocates George William and Krishnamoorthy made an urgent mention about the incident and sought the court to take suo motu cognizance of the matter. Acceding their request, the bench initiated the proceeding suo motu and sought a report from the government. On December 3, a woman who visited Sattur Government Hospital for antenatal checks was advised blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days after the procedure, it came to light that the blood transfused to her was HIV positive and was negligently labelled safe by the hospital lab technicians. Originally, the blood was donated by a teenager which was meant to be transfused to his relative. Since the blood was not used, it was sent to be stored in the blood bank. Immediately after the issue was brought to the authorities, three health workers of the blood bank in the government hospital in Sivakasi were placed under suspension for not screening the blood sample and labelling it safe. Further inquiries revealed that the hospital authorities had found that the teenage donor was found affected by HIV in 2016 when he donated blood during a camp in Sattur. The authorities should have informed the donor if the result was HIV positive. But as the teenager was out of town when a counsellor phoned him to inform, he was asked to report to the hospital as early as possible. Unfortunately, the case was not pursued though the donor failed to report to the hospital resulting in the tragedy. On Tuesday, the donor attempted to commit suicide by consuming rat poison as his family struggled to deal with the disaster."

Speaking to reporters in Madurai and Virudhunagar, after carrying out an enquiry at the Sivakasi government hospital, health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan said great injustice had been done to the woman and her family. “A preliminary inquiry has revealed that it was due to technical error and negligence, and three persons who were found to be responsible initially have been removed from service,’’ he said. He said that he had spoken to the husband of the affected woman, and he had just three requests - one that his wife be given the best medical attention, that she be shifted out of Virudhunagar, and that the state government should ensure that no other person is affected due to such negligence. The woman is expected to give birth by the end of January 2019. Radhakrishnan said a team of doctors, including Dr Shanthi, Dr Natarajan and Dr Ranjith, had been assigned to attend to the woman exclusively and recheck all parameters as per protocol. The man who donated the blood had tested positive for HIV when he came to the Sattur government hospital blood bank in 2016. But, as the Integrated counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) had not informed him about his condition, he donated the blood at the same hospital on November 30. The woman was given the infected blood when she came for an antinatal check and the Sivakasi government hospital found her anaemic. Radhakrishnan said details of blood donation are computerised, and it would be ascertained how this man was not monitored. Three employees - a councillor with the ICTC, a lab technician and another person - who have not been named have been terminated from service. Dr Radhakrishnan said that eight lakh units of blood was donated in Tamil Nadu annually, and it was given to 12 lakh persons, as different components. The blood was screened for five tests - HIV, hepatis B and C, malaria and syphilis. There was no need for the public to panic The Sattur town police on Wednesday registered an FIR against unknown nurses and doctors. The case was registered under the Section 269 of the IPC - negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life - and 338 - causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others. Virudhunagar district superintendent of police M Rajarajan said they will take action against those who are found guilty, based on the report from medical experts. The victim, accompanied by her husband, visited the Sattur police station in the morning to lodge the complaint. The woman’s husband said higher authorities in the health department had threatened him when he tried lodge a complaint with the police. Meanwhile, the teenager whose HIV positive blood was transfused to a pregnant woman has attempted suicide by consuming poison. He has been rushed to Ramanathapuram government hospital. The 19-year-old from Thirusiluviyapuram village near Kamuthi worked in a fireworks manufacturing unit in Sivakasi. Ever since he was told about his infection he had been depressed."
"69","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-death-penalty-for-sex-assault-on-minors/articleshow/67294756.cms",2018-12-29,"NEW In what is seen as a stepped up effort to crack down on child abuse, the Union Cabinet on Friday approved a set of changes in the law that will make aggravated penetrative sexual assaults during communal and sectarian violence or in the midst or aftermath of a natural calamity punishable with minimum of 20 years extending upto life imprisonment or even death. The amendments to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, set out a minimum 20 years imprisonment for “aggravated penetrative sexual assault” which includes assault on a child below 12 years. The significance in the changes adopted by the Cabinet lies in list of crime situations that fall in this category is that it will, in a first, include a person who takes advantage of a child in a situation of natural calamity to commit an sexual assault or causes the death of the victim. Going by the existing list under this provision, the enhanced punishment will apply to crimes committed on a child in communal and sectarian violence, an assault that leaves a child physically incapacitated, mentally ill, affected by HIV, disabled or pregnant. And the punishment may extend to life and even death penalty. The amendments, piloted by the WCD ministry, will now need to go to Parliament to become law. Aggravated penetrative sexual assaults as of now invite a punishment of not less than 10 years that may extend to life along with fine. The enhanced punishment will also apply to any police officer who commits penetrative sexual assault on a child in police station premises, in the course of his duty or otherwise. As per the law members of the armed forces, security forces, public servants and management and staff of jails, remand homes and protection homes guilty of such crimes will be up for the enhanced punishment. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the amendments are required to “deter the rising trend of child sex abuse in the country”. On why natural calamity situations have been included, the government has argued that children are often the worst affected by disasters. It is pointed that in the three months following the earthquake in Nepal in 2015, 513 children and women at the risk of being trafficked were intercepted. There were also reports of rape of young girls including a Kedarnath deluge survivor. To check sexual exploitation, administration of hormones to a child to induce sexual maturity to enable sexual activity has been included in the separate “aggravated sexual assault category” which will invite a jail term upto three years and fine. Possession and circulation of pornographic material involving a child for commericial purpose will invite not less than three years in jail that may extend to five and can go up to seven years if convicted the second time. In the backdrop of a spate of cases of sexual abuse emanating from children homes the aggravated sexual assault cateogry is being amended. The current provision calls for punishment for whoever on the management or on the staff of a jail, remand home commits sexual assault on a child. This will now be amended to include “or causes sexual assault by giving or receiving any payment or benefits to the child or to any other person exercising control over the child” The amendments approved by the Cabinet will enable gender neutral implemention of the punishment provisions in line with the criminal law amendment Act, 2013, that applies to rape crimes with upto death for cases involving a girl child below 12 years. The changes were a fallout of a public outcry for stricter action after the Kathua and Unnao rape cases where the victims were minors. The government’s justification for a change in provision is that media reports and complaints have revealed that children are being subjected to various kinds of sexual abuse and exploitation by making payments to children themselves, parents or guardians, or other people in whose custody the child is kept. In a recent judgement in the matter of Apna Ghar, a shelter home in Haryana, the CBI judge found the woman, who ran the shelter home, her relatives and staff, guilty of such crimes."

At the age of 21 years, she and her husband had to take a tough decision to abort the child. With a mission to change peoples’ perception about HIV/AIDS, she got herself involved in social activities for HIV community. At present, she is the face of HIV community in the country. Meet Daxa Patel, who is not only president of National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India (NCPI+), but also relentlessly working for patients, most of them outcast by the society. From organizing awareness camps to marriage fairs for HIV patients and successfully running a day-boarding school and hostel for HIV-infected children, Daxa has put her life, blood and sweat for their uplift. “When my husband and I were diagnosed with HIV in 1997, there was no treatment available. Meanwhile, I got pregnant and had no choice but to go for termination. One of the doctors told me that my lifespan was just for five months. I was searching for a person infected with HIV and I found a woman who was living with the disease for two years. This gave me confidence that I could also live long. This was the turning point in my life,” says 42-year-old Daxa. Daxa, who was doing a small embroidery business from her house, and her husband informed their family and relatives about the disease. To their surprise, the family was very supportive and this further boosted her confidence on fighting discrimination faced by people like her. Her treatment began only in 2007, 10 years after he was infected. It was in 2003, Daxa, who was earlier working as a counsellor with a city-based non-governmental organization SAHAS, got in touch with Umesh Patel. Along with Umesh and other few community members, they decided to launch a platform for HIV positive people. This is how the Gujarat State Network for People Living with HIV/ÁID (GSNP+) was launched in 2003. The main objective of GSNP+ was to assist the people infected with HIV/AIDS, ensure they get proper medical attention and timely medicines and organizing awareness programmes etc. “We used to meet the HIV patients at some deserted places and gardens to protect their identity. We started with just 35 members at GSNP+ and now we have 67,000 members across all the districts in Gujarat,” she said. Later, the NCPI+ was launched at the national level and the organization has a presence in 32 states across the country. Daxa is also running Janani Dham for the destitute HIV and AIDS infected orphaned children on the outskirts of the city since 2009. It is supported by Gujarat government’s social justice department and Surat-based P P Savani Group and has around 98 boys and girls. GSNP+ will soon launch a scheme for HIV positive people, where they can get easy medicine refill and won’t have to visit government dispensaries. This is for the first time that a project has been launched with the state government and will be introduced on national-level."

Dr Raj visited the infected woman and the donor at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai on Thursday after visiting Virudhunagar and said that steps had been taken to ensure that the woman got the best possible treatment, and priority was to ensure that her unborn infant was not affected. On the donor’s claim that he had not got any call from the counsellor at the Sivakasi government hospital on his HIV positive status after he donated blood in 2016, he said that it was under investigation. All employees of the integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) were qualified in their respective fields and were appointed on contract basis which was renewed annually, with no recruitments being made in recent times, he said. The functioning of the centres was foolproof and that was why the longevity of the infected persons had gone up from 30 to 40 years when they were under regular medication. He urged mediapersons to refrain from interacting with the donor, who had claimed that he had attempted to commit suicide because the media was cornering him. Members of the Positive Network people were also interacting with him and his condition had stabilised, he said. Earlier, speaking at Virudhunagar, he said that 464 units of blood from the four blood banks in Virudhunagar district had been secured and re-examined and those from private banks would also be subjected to the same."

The state blood transfusion council announced that asking relatives of patients to donate blood for elective procedures or deliveries will be a punishable offence and lead to temporary closure of the hospital and blood bank. Yet, across the state most public hospitals have been asking relatives of pregnant women and other patients to donate blood as a replacement. This is how on November 30, a 19-year-old person infected with HIV, though he did not know it at that point, ended up donating blood; his relative, a pregnant woman, required a blood transfusion and he donated to replace it. The infected blood was issued to another hospital and given to another woman, who has now tested positive for HIV. “When the state announced the policy it said that hospitals like all other service providers should ensure patients and their relatives are not harassed,” said Doctors Association for Social Equality general secretary Dr G R Ravindranath. “It had asked blood banks to look for safer methods such as periodic blood donation camps. For its own hospitals and primary health centres it had charted out a plan to organise blood donation camps. But that never happened. District collectors and blood safety officers should have ensured they are stocked. Most banks don’t even offer blood components,” he said. Repeated voluntary blood donation is promoted because risks are lower. The state did not hold massive awareness programmes to encourage repeated voluntary blood donation. Statistics show less than three out of ten donors in the state volunteer to donate repeatedly. The incident has come as a blow to the state health department, which has been ranked second in health by Niti Ayog in the Sustainable Development Goals India baseline report, 2018, with a maternal mortality ratio of 66 compared to the national average of 130. It has one of highest number of government doctors, nurses and midwives per 100,000 population in the country. “Yet, it is sad that the state which boasts of being a leader in public health care doesn’t have a safe blood policy. When 60% of women deliver at GHs, shouldn’t the state stock adequate blood. Why should they rely on replacement blood at all? In this case it was not even a rare blood group. Most labs don’t even have standard testing equipment or trained staff,” said HIV/AIDS activist K Radhakrishnan. The average consumption of blood in upgraded PHC and community health centres is 60 units a year and taluk hospitals require about 200 units. Most hospitals don’t stock adequate blood because the co-ordination between the blood bank officer and the doctors is very poor."

After months of rejection, this feels like a whiff of fresh air and finally, it feels like the youths can dream big. We have lined up appointments to see the spaces over this week and hopefully, we can finalise a place by the end of this month,” said Kallol Ghosh, the founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for the HIV-positive youths at Narendrapur. TOI had reported on Monday that the group of 6 young boys and 4 girls have undergone training in baking, sandwich-making and coffee and mocktail-making and aspired to start their own coffee shop named ‘Café Positive’. However, months of making rounds of several properties in some of the prominent locations in south Kolkata — like Lake Road, Dover Lane, Hindusthan Park, Gol Park and Ballygunge — yielded no result. The moment the house owners came to know about the medical condition of the youths, they started distancing them from the project and refused to offer the space on rent citing “problems to be caused by the neighbourhood and family”. “Everywhere, we were turned down and at one point of time, we felt like our dream can never come true. But then, things started to change from Monday morning. Our teachers at the Home have said several people are calling us up to offer space on rent. This news itself is special for us,” said Sathi Biswas (name changed), a Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies. As per the plan, the youths want to set up a café on a 750 square feet ground floor space. The food and beverages will be served on disposable plates and there would be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding or cut injuries. “There will be a corner in the café where people can even make their own coffee. We will also have a space where people can make their own food items and sell it from our outlet by paying us a portion of the sales. There will also be regular gigs and space for budding musicians in the city. And of course, there will be posters and tent cards, making people aware of the disease and the myths surrounding it,” said Sanmit Das (name changed), another Class XII student.

Her husband, who is a daily-wage labourer, said the family did not want a government job as compensation, only the best medical care for the woman and child, which is expected to be born in January. The government has arranged all facilities at the Madurai government hospital and sacked three employees for the tragic mix-up.

One, the donor had been identified as HIV positive two years ago, in 2016, when he donated blood at a camp in Sattur, a town in Virudhunagar district. The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at the government hospital there should have told the youth he had HIV. The counsellor did call him up but he said he was Bangalore and she only told him to report to the centre. Counsellors normally do not break the news over phone.

The woman, a B.Com graduate, had come to the GH for antenatal checks. Doctors told her she had to undergo blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days later, a private hospital in Madurai tested the donor positive for HIV and referred him to Sattur GH.“He had gone to the private hospital because blood tests were mandatory for an employment visa.

Mizoram’s population is about 11 lakh and about 18,081 were found to be HIV positive between October 1990 and August this year. In Mizoram, the trend of HIV positive cases is on the rise. ""Therefore if we have to make things right, our minds and hearts have to be right. I mean we have to shun the path of evil and embrace the path of God,"" Hlawndo said, adding that his party is for bringing in moral transformation, rather than material reforms. Hlawndo’s party has fielded 24 candidates for the 40-member assembly polls on November 28. Hlawndo is contesting from two seats--- in Serchhip he is pitted against chief minister Lal Thanhawla and in Aizawl West-I. He prefers to call his party candidates including himself as 'apostles' of ""moral transformation"" for Mizoram. Among the 24 candidates who are contesting as Independents, there are three women, including Hlawndo's two daughters. In his meetings, Hlawndo says his part's intention is not to be the rulers, but servants of God. ""God is going to make the nation. We will serve as his servants,"" he said. As an evangelist, Hlawndo has a strong followers in the Christian-majority state. If Hlawndo has the theological solution to the problem of HIV, the ruling Congress and the opposition Mizo National Front (MNF) have virtually failed to make it a major health issue in the current election. ""Our manifesto focuses on the health issues in a comprehensive way which also includes HIV. If we come to power, the problem of HIV will be dealt with in an effective way,"" Congress spokesperson, Lallian Chhunga said. MNF chief and party's chief ministerial candidate, Zoramthanga said it was Congress government’s failure to check the spread of HIV. ""HIV issue is a serious one. We will deal with it seriously when we are in power,"" Zoramthanga said."

Senators on Wednesday passed the measure, which would keep government running to 8 February. The House of Representatives needs to pass similar bill to avoid a government shutdown this weekend. House, in which the Republicans currently has a majority, is expected to pass the bill, but unlikely to include funding for the border wall. Unless the issue is resolved, more than 800,000 federal workers would face furloughs or be forced to work without pay, disrupting government operations days before Christmas. Democratic Leader and Speaker-designate, Nancy Pelosi, said her party would support the bill to avert government shutdown. The House is likely to pass the bill on Thursday, before it heads to the President Donald Trump to sign it into law. Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with top congressional Democratic leaders last week that he would be ""proud"" to shut down part of the government in service of forcing Congress to give him the full $5 billion he wants for a border wall. The administration appeared to soften its stance on Tuesday when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox News, ""At the end of the day we don't want to shut down the government."" The border wall was central to Trump's presidential campaign. ""The American people know the president's wall is ineffective, expensive, and only serves as a political bone to his most conservative supporters – certainly not worth a government shutdown,"" Senator Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader, said. ""It's good that Republicans in the Senate finally realised that they should not shut down the government over a wall that does not have enough support to pass the House or Senate and is not supported by a majority of the country,"" Schumer said. ""It is unfortunate that Trump's demand for a border wall from sea to shining sea has held up seven appropriations bills that have been debated and passed out of committee on a bipartisan basis,"" said Senator Dick Durbin."

He launched a trust called Shuddhidhan Pratishtan in an endeavour to provide free ambulance services to the needy. Over the last 18 years as an ambulance driver, Jagtap has gone out of his way to help many old, ailing and abandoned persons go back to their families and helped police transport accident victims to hospitals. He has played a key role in reuniting nearly 70 abandoned patients with their families, sometimes resorting to threatening the families to take them back. Along with his friend Mahadev Kishanrao Pol, Jagtap has earned thousands of blessings by his small gestures. “I used to work as a mason till 2001 when my brother, who was an ambulance driver, unable to earn enough, drank poison. I saved him and then started driving the ambulance myself. Soon after, I took over the ambulance, I was informed about a boy who had drowned in Katraj Lake. The police and fire-brigade recovered the body and I took it to Sassoon General Hospital for a postmortem and then to his home. His mother did not have money to pay me for the ambulance services. It moved me so much that I launched my trust for people who cannot pay for these services.” According to Jagtap, while working at Sassoon hospital, he came across social worker MB Shelke. “Shelke told me about abandoned patients. He said he would bear the diesel costs if I started locating the homes of the abandoned patients and ensured that they reached home. I started helping these patients. I have come across several cases wherein patients were abandoned by their families and some cases wherein the patient was assumed dead,” he said. Jagtap can never forget Haribhau Khutwad. “He was from Dapoli and we drove down there and roamed around the town for an entire day in search of his residence. We found out that he had provided us with the wrong address. We were able to identify the house where his son stayed with his in-laws. On reaching the house, the son told us that he will give us the address of their native village where Khutwad should be dropped. On enquiry, I found out that there was no one to support him at his native village. I then threatened his son with a police complaint if he abandoned his father. That was when the son took him back,” Jagtap said. He also remembered an AIDS patient, Hirabai Chorge, who was brought to Sassoon Hospital some years ago after people found her unconscious at Alandi. “She underwent treatment and asked to be taken to her sister’s house. On reaching the sister’s house, she refused to take her, saying that Chorge was survived by her son, daughter and mother-in-law. We reached the house to find it locked and understood that the son had taken her to Alandi and abandoned her there. I spoke to the local boys in the area, who had been informed that Chorge was living in an old-age home. I told them what the son had done, after which the friends m and ensured he was taken y the family.” Jagtap said e has come cross instances when amilies do not want to ven sit with e mortal reins in the ulance. remember e was a dengue outbreak in the city and a patient had died. The family did not want to step into the ambulance. I had to carry the body to the ambulance and drive it to the crematorium by myself while the family members came in their private cars. In another incident of murder, the body was lying in the ambulance for 14 days before I drove it to Baramati for the last rites,” he stated. According to Jagtap, he has received letters of appreciation from hospitals and individuals who have been helped by Shuddhidhan Pratishtan. “I provide free ambulance services throughout Ganeshotsav. I had accompanied a team from Bharati Vidyapeeth to Sangli when it was struck by floods. I used to transport differentlyabled persons to Tarachand Hospital in Rasta Peth for two years when they had a special camp going on,” he explained. Jagtap said he plans to work for the needy as long as possible. ""My son recently started working in a bank and my other child is studying at MIT. While they have got on with their lives, I plan to continue driving the ambulance and my work under the Shuddhidhan Pratishthan for as long as I live,"" he added."

In Trichy, the initiative will cover Trichy Central Prison, Special Prison for Women and nine sub-jails under the control of the central prison. Officials from the health department said that though the prevalence of HIV and TB is not high among inmates in the prisons in Trichy, since they are considered to be a special group and vulnerable to diseases, the initiative would check the spread of the diseases. Sources from the department said that around six inmates in Trichy prisons are HIV positive, while around five have TB. Such prisoners are put-up in separate cell blocks. While there are 1,263 inmates in central prison currently, around 70 are in special prison for women and 75 in sub-jails. Three medical officers are deputed to central prison and two for women’s prison, while doctors from the respective primary health centres inspect the inmates in sub-jails. Trichy programme manager of district aids prevention and control unit (DAPCU), Dr S Martin Manivannan, said that the main goal behind the initiative is to spread awareness about HIV and TB among prisoners and curb the spread of diseases within the prison and after their release. “We would give sensitisation programmes to inmates on possibilities on spread of HIV. Apart from this, tests would be done for those with HIV symptoms so that they are given timely treatment,” he said. Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri told TOI that sputum samples of all the inmates with TB symptoms would be collected over the next few days and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) would be performed to detect TB."

This is a significant improvement from a decade ago, when over two HIV+ cases were recorded per day. While men constituted 60% of the total number of HIV+ cases in the first trimester of this year, no transgenders and transsexuals were detected with the condition for the second year in a row. Mormugao continued to be the taluka with the highest number of HIV+ cases (27%), while Salcete came in second at 16%. Bardez, the taluka that had in the past years reported the second-highest and, sometimes, highest number of HIV+ cases in the state, accounted for only six of the total cases in the first three months of 2018. No new cases were reported from Sattari, Sanguem and Canacona. The predominant mode of transmission of HIV has continued to be the sexual route, with over 90% of such cases reported. Transmission modes involving infected syringes, needles, blood and blood products have been negligible in the state. Although five deaths due to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in January and February this year, chief medical officer of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), Dr Chandrakant Parab, said the launch of the ‘test and treat’ policy last April is expected to reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths further. Under the policy, anyone diagnosed as an HIV+ patient is put on antiretroviral therapy (ART), irrespective of the clinical stage or CD4 count—a snapshot of how the patient’s immune system is functioning. In the past, ART, which suppresses the activity of the HIV retrovirus, was recommended only in cases where it was considered necessary. Since the implementation of the ‘test and treat’ policy, more than 370 HIV+ persons have been put on ART in a phased manner in the state. “ART, which can slow down the rate at which HIV weakens the immune system, is now administered to everybody: Men, women, adolescents and children,” Parab said, pointing out that the move is expected to keep their immune system strong and healthy and improve their longevity and quality of life. Parab said the elimination of stigma is vital to ensure that people who have the slightest doubt of their status voluntarily come forward to get tested and seek treatment. “Those indulging in risky behaviour must also protect themselves, as HIV is 100% preventable,” he added."

Combined data for Gujarat, Daman and Dadra Nagar Haveli reveals that 0.19% of men in the age group of 15-49 were HIV positive while the number for women in the same age group was 0.18%. The data further reveals that in the age group of 15-54, the number increased to 0.24%. The officials said that in the 15-24 years group, prevalence was more than any other age group. Interestingly, in this age group, no female was found to be HIV positive. The data also reveals that these are the percentage of HIV positive women and men tested by groups of states or Union territories. The data further reveals that of the 0.48% married couples who are HIV positive only 0.04% were couples where both spouses were HIV positive. The data further revealed that 0.22% men were HIV positive with their wives being HIV negative. Similarly, in 0.22% it was the wife who was HIV positive while the husband was not HIV positive. The survey also brought to light the failure of the government to create awareness about HIV. According to the data released, only 69% of men and 43% of women were aware that use of condoms during sex can prevent HIV. Among men, Gujarat ranked 10 from the bottom when it came to knowledge of condoms and women were the fourth worst, better only than Bihar, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Nagaland. The data reveals the awareness of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV/AIDS was very poor in Gujarat among women, Dadra and Nagar Haveli has the lowest awareness (16%) of MTCT, followed by Bihar (33%) and Gujarat (34%). The data further reveals that only 59% women were aware of HIV, while among 77% men had awareness about HIV. The data further reveals that only 1% of women had high-risk intercourse in 2015-16 while 6.8% of men had high-risk intercourse in same period. Also, only 23.6% women and men knew how to prevent HIV/AIDS and another 20% had comprehensive knowledge. Divyang Oza, the project officer of the AIDS Control Society said that teenage groups are the most affected and the most common mode of infection was sexual transmission. The second strongest mode for HIV transmission is blood transfusion. It also cannot be denied that many couples only use condom for family planning and are unaware that it can be used to prevent HIV. Oza further said that HIV awareness has to be increased, but it is a time-consuming process and while there has been an improvement, it is less than expected."

More than four decades later, though he is today married to a woman and has fathered a daughter, Daniel publicly identifies himself as ‘Celia Deniels’, a woman, and dresses as one. “My wife and daughter accept me as I am,” she says. On Monday, Celia, who lives and works in the USA, performed English and Tamil songs to a small gathering. Just like Celia, almost a dozen other transwomen shared their life stories and exhibited their artistic talents at an event titled Trans Talents Rendezvous that was organised by Sahodari Foundation in the city. The event also marked the 10th anniversary of the foundation, which was started by transgender artist and activist Kalki Subramaniam to help change the lives transgender people. “Sahodari was born in pain,” says Kalki. “I was angry on seeing the way people from the transgender community were being treated. A transgender friend of mine was raped in front of my eyes and she died of HIV. So, I started Sahodari 10 years ago to work for the welfare of transgender people.” Through the foundation, a group of transgender people made a set of short films in 2009, depicting their lives. “The movies were widely viewed. The videos also helped to campaign for the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in the legal battle to scrap Section 377,” Kalki says. Through the foundation, she has sensitized several school and college students. The event saw dance and music performances, plays and a discussion between Kalki and transgender writer and activist Revathi. Bara Bobby, a transgender engineering graduate, who is also a trained bharatanatyam dancer, performed a dance, while Soundarya, Sabitha and Vineetha, all from the transgender community, performed a group dance. Art is a potent way to claim one’s rights, say the artistes. “While there are several art festivals organised by the state, transgender people are not represented in them. But today we have created several avenues to showcase our talents,” says Revathi. Kalki expressed a similar view. “Art is both entertaining and educating.

Two women rescued from the streets of Mumbai 18 years ago will marry their suitors at a shelter home for homeless. Hasiya Philip (23) ran away from home as a six-year-old as she could not bear the beating of her stepmother. She was rescued from Bhandup and sent to SEAL (Social and Evangelical Association for Love) Ashram shelter in Panvel. And Usha Philip (24) had come to Mumbai from Gujarat to search for her sister as a little girl, but got lost at Girgaum Chowpatty. She too was rescued by a social worker and sent to the shelter, where they both grew up together and lived with other inmates. SEAL members said it is a very happy occasion for them as the girls have found grooms through arranged marriage. The brides-to-be told TOI that sometimes they wonder and shudder what their fate would have been had they not been rescued. Therefore, they are grateful at how things have turned out for them. “I don’t like to remember my childhood, when my stepmom used to beat me up. I don’t know which city or town I was in, but I got into several long-distance trains to finally land in Mumbai suburbs. The 18 years at SEAL have been happy, and I am a bit sad to leave this wonderful place to get married. I can never forget SEAL Ashram and Pastor Philip, who is my father now,” said Fasiya. SEAL founder, Pastor K M Philip, said, “When Fasiya came to us as a child, she had nail injury marks all over her neck. Her stepmom used to grab her by the neck and beat her. Over the years, Fasiya became a good student and a great cook. She also did a beautician’s course. It is nothing short of a miracle that she and Usha are settling down by getting married.” Fasiya will marry a man who works in Oman and Usha a pastor based in Rajasthan. “All children at SEAL call Pastor Philip and his wife Shibi “papa and mommy” as they have taken care of us over the years. That is why we feel sad to leave this place, but will always stay in touch with our parents and friends here,” said Usha. “I have seen them grow up from being traumatized, lost girls to elegant ladies who will now have their very own families and homes to look after. I thank the Lord for making us do and see such good things. Tomorrow, Fasiya and Usha will help others in distress, as they remember that they too were once blessed by the Almighty and helped to find their feet,” said pastor Philip. SEAL, an NGO, works for rescue and rehabilitation of destitute and missing people on railway platforms and streets of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The shelter home has 258 rescued people, mainly HIV/TB patients, mentally challenged, handicapped, visually impaired and fully orphaned. SEAL has reunited 354 with families in India."

Villagers started the process of refilling the lake with water from the Malaprabha Right canal on Wednesday. The 36-acre Morab lake is one of the biggest lakes in district and is the only source of drinking water for the villagers. It is said that the woman had committed suicide by jumping into the lake last week and her body was found on November 29. Villagers stopped drinking water from the lake from that day itself, fearing that the water was contaminated. Morab gram panchayat member Laxman Patil told TOI that the lake was the only source of drinking water, villagers had refused to drink the water and had demanded authorities to drain the lake and fill it with fresh water. The authorities buckled under pressure and started draining the lake last week. “We deployed four motors and 20 six-inch pipes to pump out water from the lake on November 30. We took nearly 10 days to completely empty the lake,” said Patil. Basavaraj Melavanki, GP water man of Morab said, “Villagers are still fetching water from Malaprabha right canal by trekking 1-2 km daily. They have remained adamant and have not even touched the lake water. More than 50 persons were involved in the task of pumping out water from the lake.” “On Tuesday evening we completely emptied the lake and started the process of refilling it on Wednesday morning. We had discharged the water to a nearby stream. Some villagers used this water for their fields. Now, water is flowing into the lake from the Malaprabha right canal and it will take about 5-6 days to refill it,” added Melavanki. Navalgund tahsildar Naveen Hullur said, “When all our efforts to convince the villagers about using the lake water went in vain, we extended our full support to the villagers to drain the lake. Once the lake is filled in a few days, villagers can start consuming the like before.” Villagers have now appealed to the GP and taluk administration to depute one or two security guards at the lake to prevent people from jumping in to the water to commit suicide and contaminate the water.

This means that every fourth person in the largely sexually active age group in the state have not heard about. The fact, noted in the recently released fourth National Family Health Survey report, explains why incidents like the one in Unnao can take place in the state. To recall, over 50 persons belonging to a couple of villages in Unnao's Bangarmau area tested positive to HIV infection in a period of seven months. While a quack who reportedly administered injection to locals with the same syringe is being blamed for the havoc, theory of the affected persons contracting the infection as a result of unsafe sexual behaviour is not being ruled out. The report also assessed higher risk sex among men and women of UP. Higher-risk sex refers to sexual intercourse with someone who is neither a spouse nor a cohabiting partner. Among those who had sex in the past 12 months, only 1% women and 9% men reported having higher-risk sex during the period. The trend was higher in urban than rural areas. A small proportion of respondents said that they had multiple sex partners in past one year (0.3% of women and 3% of men). Over one-fourth of men (26%) who had higher-risk sex in the past 12 months reported using a condom the last time they had higher-risk sex. One percent of men said they had paid for sex in the past year. Though the numbers are small, 34% men who paid for sexual intercourse in past one year used a condom the last time they paid for sexual intercourse. The report also showed that only 18% women and 26% men in the state have a comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS. This means that they know that consistent use of condoms during sex and having just one uninfected committed sex partner can reduce the chance of it . But on an overall scale, 52% women and 26% men were not aware of the importance of use of condoms and commitment. Comprehensive knowledge of HIV-AIDS also entails awareness to the fact that a healthy-looking person can have it and they reject common misconceptions about transmission or prevention of HIV-AIDS. Over 65% women 59% men did not show accepting attitude towards indicators assessing stigma. The indicators were: 'willing to take care of relative with HIV/AIDS', 'would buy vegetables from an HIV positive vendor', 'believe that an HIV positive but healthy school teacher could take classes' and 'would not keep HIV status of their relative as a secret) assessing stigma towards HIV-AIDS.'"

The jail authorities said over the past one year, the centre did not get any of the HIV-positive inmates tested to start their treatment. As a result, they were not taking any medicines. The centre project officer, on the other hand, claimed that they were getting tests conducted as well as providing medicines to inmates free of cost. A 38-year-old HIV-positive prisoner had died at civil hospital in Old City on December 9, a day after his admission. Jail officials said besides being HIV positive, the deceased prisoner had tuberculosis and Hepatitis C, too. While his family claimed that he did not get “proper treatment” in the prison, jail superintendent Shamsher Singh Boparai said they did everything they could. There are 130 HIV-positive prisoners in Ludhiana Central Jail. “Of these, 127 are waiting for their CD4 test from the past one year,” said Boparai. For being administered medicines, the patients have to undergo the CD4 test. It measures the number of CD4 cells in the blood, and the immunity of the patient. With the help of this test, the doctor decides the treatment course. Anti-retroviral therapy centres, which come under National Aids Control Organisation, conduct this test and provide medicines free of cost. The centre project officer, Dr Simran Wander, said, “The jail authorities’ claims are baseless. Representatives of an NGO associated with the centre are deployed in the jail laboratory. They keep a record of the virus-infected patients and regularly get all tests conducted to ensure timely treatment of inmates.” Boparai, however, said, “Only two employees of the NGO sit in the laboratory and keep the medical record. Apart from that, they do nothing. No treatment is being provided to the 127 prisoners. The three others are paying for medicines from their own pockets.” “First, it is the responsibility of the jail to get inmates’ tests conducted and start their treatment. If it is short of funds, then the centre has to step in for HIV-positive patients,” he added. Punjab Aids Control Society project officer Manpreet Chattwal could not be contacted despite repeated attempts."

The number of MSMs on gay dating sites and social networking platforms is huge. Earlier, such men were found in cozying spots such as Kasturchand Park. “We had identified 30 spots in Nagpur where the community used to come and meet for either hookups, friendships, time pass or sexual encounters.

In Nagpur, the project has been divided area-wise into two groups since the past three years and has been handed over to Sarathi trust and Mumbai’s Gaurav Trust. “Sarathi looks after Sitabuldi, Gandhibagh and east Nagpur areas, whereas Kasturchand Park and areas of west Nagpur come under the purview of Gaurav Trust,” said Chandrani, founder of Sarathi trust. Awareness regarding HIV/AIDS, condom distribution, screening and counselling for men who have sex with men is the agenda of this project. It includes gays, bisexuals and transgenders, and Sarathi has found 89 HIV positive cases from cases registered under them. “We have identified 1,450 MSMs and 50 transgenders under this project. Previously, under a project called Pehchan supported by Global Fund, we had registered 2,500 people. After it was over, we requested MSACS to transfer these people to MSM project so that services can be continued, but due to unavailability of budget, we have not been able to do it,” said Chandrani. Presently, MSM project has been allotted five outreach workers, 1 accountant, 1 officer, 1 project manager and a counsellor along with part-time peer educators. “If we increase the target, we will need double staff and double salary,” said Chandrani, adding that the annual budget for the project is Rs25 lakh."

Unable to convince them, the authorities are now draining the water from the 36-acre lake — roughly the size of 25 football fields — which they hope to refill with water from the Malaprabha canal. The Morab lake is the biggest in Navalgund taluk and the only source of drinking water for villagers and cattle. As of now, villagers trek 2-3km to the Malaprabha canal to fetch water. “This is unfortunate. We have been telling people not to panic as HIV does not spread through water. But the people are not convinced and they have started draining out the lake,” said Dharwad district health officer Dr Rajendra Doddamani. Dr Glory Alexander, founder-director of Asha Foundation, which treats HIV+ patients, said it was a case of fear rather than stigma. ""It's sheer ignorance stemming from lack of awareness. When an HIV positive person dies, the virus also dies. Even if the virus comes out of the body, it cannot survive in water and dies in a couple of seconds. There is no risk of infection spreading from the water,"" she said. The body of the woman was found in the lake on November 29. Word immediately spread the water had been contaminated, creating panic. Villagers refused to drink the water and pressured the gram panchayat and the Navalgund taluk administration to drain the lake. Authorities tried to convince the villagers that the water was not contaminated and that they would test the water, but no one relented. The authorities have now deployed 20 siphon tubes with four motors to pump out the water. “We found the body in a highly decomposed state,” said Muttanna Bhavaikatti, from Morab village. “We don’t want to consume contaminated water. We are trekking 2-3km to fetch water from the Malaprabha right bank canal that flows through Morab.” Pradeep Hanikere, another villager, said the daily hardship was preferable to drinking water from the lake. “Do the officials drink bottled water if they find dirt or a speck in it? If they can’t, then how can they force us to drink water from the lake where we found the body of a woman,” he said. Another villager pointed out, “We would have consumed the water if it was the body of a normal person; but the woman died of HIV. There is no other way: The authorities must drain out water and fill it with fresh water to save the lives of villagers.” Gram panchayat member Laxman Patil said the villagers refused to see reason, so pipes have been sucking water out for the past four days. “We managed to drain out lakhs of litres, and discharged the water in a nearby stream. We still have to drain water from 60% of the lake and need at least five days to empty it,” he said. There is another problem, though. “The taluk administration wants us to complete the task by December 6. They have warned the Malaprabha right canal will be closed after December 8, so we have to fill the water into lake before that. More than 50 people are involved in pumping out water. We will need 1-2 weeks to empty and fill the lake.” Navalgund tahsildar Naveen Hullur said: “We tried our best to convince people to drink the lake water but they refused outright. We offered to conduct tests to prove that the water is fit to drink. I will talk to officials to allow us to fill the lake from Malaprabha canal till December 20 or 22.”"

Data for the last 10 years, since Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) Centres were opened in Vizianagaram and Parvathipuram divisions clearly indicate the declining trend, while the number of people being screened and tested has gone up three times approximately in the same time period (over the last decade). Talking to TOI, the Vizianagaram AIDS and Leprosy control officer, S Ravi Kumar, pointed out that the number of people testing HIV positive has come down both numerically and percentage wise. “We attribute this decrease chiefly to the rise in awareness over the last decade after ART centres were established. A massive public awareness campaign was conducted across the district and target groups were identified,” Kumar said. Referring to the data, Kumar said, “In 2008, when we began screening and testing people for HIV, out of the 22,672 tested, 1,771, turned to be HIV positive. Nine years later, for the year 2017, a total 73,360 were tested and only 633 turned out to be positive. The percentage of people, who tested positive in 2007 was 7.61% against 0.80% for 2017-2018.” Referring to HIV in pregnant women, AIDS control officials noted that 176 out of 29, 562 tested positive for the year 2008-2009, while only 29 out of the 60,686 tested positive last year, bringing the percentage count from close to 1% to less than 0.05%. The officials observed that this downward trend was continuing this year as well. Regarding the provision of treatment to affected people at the ART centres, the officials observed that earlier tablets were dispensed every month, but because of logistical issues, some of the affected were unable to turn up on time. They said that a special multi-dispensation programme was initiated by the National AIDS Control Society and training for the multi-dispensation programme was initiated for the staff members of the two ART centres in the district on Saturday, under the guidance of the DCHS (district community health services) officials."

The photo revealed to the world that Chinmay Modi, an alumnus of social work faculty of MS University, was infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Modi and his parents’ lives changed overnight in 2002 when all three had tested positive for HIV. Born and brought up in Surat, Modi, after the photo was published, had to face a volley of questions not only from his friends and classmates, but also from his teachers. Modi’s friends used to tell him that they have been instructed by their parents not to meet or talk to him. Modi said some of them even questioned him why he was studying since people living with HIV positive die early. Modi started questioning himself then, but now Modi laughs at the discriminatory treatment meted out to him. “I never complained regarding discrimination at home, because there used to be sadness all the time. However, a few years later my parents and I had discussion about it and our relations changed since then,” said Modi, who now works with Global Youth Network of People Living with HIV. After finishing his postgraduation from MSU in 2016, Modi became a full-time activist working for people living with HIV positive. He joined National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India and currently works with Global Youth Network of People Living with HIV (Y+ network).

Health minister Vishwajit Rane made the statement while speaking as chief guest after attending Positive Power Summit 2018 organized by Human Touch, a voluntary organisation on the eve of World AIDS Day on Friday. Listening to various difficulties faced by children suffering from HIV, Rane said that the government will come up with a new policy and grants from the state budget will be provided for various initiatives to create infrastructure so that children afflicted with HIV can live a better quality of life. “We, as policy-makers, need to change the narrative. We need to be more sensitive on how to take this issue forward,” he added. Project director, Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), Dr Jose D’Sa said that the main goal is to attain zero HIV infection, zero conversion of HIV to AIDS, zero AIDS-related threats and most importantly, to remove discrimination. GSACS, he said, is trying to achieve this goal by 2020. Founder, Human Touch, Peter Borges said that during the last two years in Goa, 610 people have been found infected as HIV positive. He further said HIV is not only transmitted by sex but is transmitted by sexism, poverty and homophobia. “If we are going to end the menace of AIDS, we must cure the disease in our heart and minds,” he said. The organisation also appealed to stakeholders and the state government to take unprecedented and bold actions to advance efforts to end AIDS in the state by 2030.

Speaking to TOI, the NGO said a change of mindset in talking about sex is necessary to fight the AIDS menace. Since 2008, the NGO has counselled more than 1000 individuals who are MSMs (men who have sex with men) in different locations of Nalbari district. Pancharatna has been bestowed with the responsibility to carry out the Targeted Intervention (TI) project with MSMs and transgenders. Health workers of the NGO have succeeded to persuade 22 MSMs to have health check-ups which detected that they were HIV positive. Fear of being ostracized had been one of the factors that kept the 22 men secretive about their sexual orientation and unable to take preventive measures. “It’s been a very difficult journey over the last 10 years. People still shy away from discussing sex. And the people who are MSM don’t want to speak openly at all. They would always hide. So, it becomes even more difficult to trace them,” Mahendra Baishya, chairman of Pancharatna, told TOI. “After we notice homosexual behaviour, we engage with them by making friends with the help of our workers with similar feelings towards the same sex. That’s how they become open and then we persuade them for blood tests and the next steps,” Baishya added. If anyone is found to be positive, they are immediately sent to the Gauhati Medical College Hospital for further treatment. He said that the age group of these 22 detected positive is from 20 to 35. “Many of them are married but they were continuing unsafe MSM activities. This has also introduced threats for their wives and newborns. This is very dangerous,” said Baishya. Narrating his experiences of the last decade, Baishya said only 30% change has come. “People don’t want to discuss sex openly. Until and unless we change this kind of mindset, we will not be able to fight this menace,” said Baishya. The most effective means of controlling the spread of HIV in India is through the implementation of Targeted Interventions (TIs) amongst persons most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgenders and injecting drug users. As per the India HIV Estimation 2017 Fact Sheet, it is estimated that Assam has 13,539 people living with the disease. HIV prevalence in Assam is 0.06%, lower than the national average, which is 0.22%. “The scenario is not at all pleasant because Assam is vulnerable to new HIV infections mainly because of inflow and outflow of migrants,” said Samir Sinha, principal secretary of health and family welfare department."

Struck by the tragedy and worried for his soon-to-be-born child, Sharma's life turned upside-down and he did not know what to do. With a strong determination to lead a normal life, Sharma started Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) treatment with his family's support. Besides, he also set up a shelter home for HIV-positive orphaned children in his hometown Ujjain in 2014. ""I was suffering from some health issues and was diagnosed with liver infection. I decided to go for a thorough medical check-up. The results left me in utter shock. I was more worried about my pregnant wife and the yet-to-be-born child,"" he said while sharing his ordeal with the TOI. ""My mother proved my biggest strength. I went to the National AIDS Control Organisation in Delhi for treatment where I came across a person, who was on ART treatment for last 10 years and was leading a normal life. The meeting gave me a new hope. I got my wife tested. Thankfully, she tested negative and later we also got our son tested who also tested negative. I breathed a sigh of relief and started my medicines,"" said Sharma. Speaking about the stigma faced by HIV-positive persons, Sharma said apart from common people, some doctors too are biased against HIV+ and AIDS patients. ""I fractured my thigh in 2014, but doctors refused to perform surgery when they found out that I was HIV positive. Even pregnant HIV-positive women face difficulties as doctors refuse to perform delivery. This mentality has to be done away with,"" he said. In 2006, Sharma set up Ujjain HIV/AIDS Network People's Society where he works for the welfare of HIV-positive people. ""Many people lose hope of leading a normal life. We come together and help them start ART treatment and also provide them morale support. There is a myth that HIV-positive people cannot get married or have children. We got many HIV-positive people married and with proper treatment their children tested negative which gave them hope,"" he said. Sharma also started working for HIV-positive children after he came across cases where such children had nowhere to go after their parents died and relatives refused to take them in. With the help of a local missionary he established a shelter home for HIV positive orphans in 2014. ""Ours is the only centre for HIV-positive kids in the state.

Senior inspector Satish Mane of the Wakad police said, “Medical reports of the woman shows that she has been infected with HIV from January. She alleged that her husband had injected her with infected blood while administrating saline when she was unwell in March last year.” The woman said she underwent clinical tests when her condition deteriorated. “The woman stated in her complaint that she did not have physical relationships with anyone other than her husband,” Mane said. He said the police were yet to investigate if the husband was responsible for administering the HIV-infected blood into her body. “Based on her complaint, we have booked her husband and sent her blood samples to a laboratory,” Mane said. Infectious disease expert Bharat Purandare said, “It is possible to transmit HIV either through an infected needle or by giving transfusion of infected blood. If the woman knows whose infected needle or blood was used to transmit the virus, a DNA test can be carried out on her and the HIV-affected person to establish the link.” The woman stated in her complaint after her marriage in 2015, her husband and in-laws started harassing her for money to start a business. “The woman’s father used to give in to their demands. However, the woman later refused to contact her father for more money, resulting in mental and physical harassment by the in-laws and her husband,” Mane said. The woman said her husband hatched a plot to administer her HIV-infected blood because he did not have strong grounds for a divorce. The husband and his parents have been booked under sections 498A, 323, 504 and 506 of IPC. “The husband has already filed for divorce in court,” Mane said."

Targeted interventions among female sex workers and MSM (men who have sex with men) seem to be more helpful in preventing spread of AIDS. Most sex workers have now started engaging in sex with a limited number of clients and that too with only those who are personally known to them, according to people working among such communities. NGOs working among sex workers said the clients are also ready to undergo frequent medical check-ups. ""Nowadays, not many of them are seen on the streets. They work during daytime and meet only a limited number of clients who are known to them,"" said Shaji P M, coordinator of Chola, a Kannur-based NGO. Since the sex workers know most of their clients, they make sure that the ones who come to them undergo medical check-ups for HIV and other infections, he said. There are 749 female sex workers in contact with Chola and nearly 80% of them practice such methods, he said, adding there were 12 HIV-infected sex workers here a few years ago but none of them are working in the sex industry now. With the advent of smartphones and social media, the coordination has become easy for them and it has reduced the risk. According to Snehatheeram, another NGO, sexual minorities, including members of the MSM community, have also been following such methods . In the MSM community, there are people from all classes and now most of them indulge in sexual activity with known partners and it has reduced the risk of HIV infection, said an employee of the NGO. Thanks to such interventions initiated by the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), with the support of the NGOs, the risk of HIV infection has come down considerably, said Dennis Joseph, joint director of the society. ""The spread of HIV among sex workers has been reduced from 1.75% nearly a decade back to 0.01% now,"" he said. Last year, only four cases of HIV infection were reported among the sex workers in the state, and only two of them were registered with KSACS and two were outsiders, said KSACS. Similar interventions were made among drug users which helped them curb the habit of sharing syringes. Moreover, after realizing that they resort to crime to get money to procure drugs, facility was provided to get them drug, as part of the treatment, he said. As a result, the prevalence of HIV infection rate among drug abusers has come down from 10.5% to 0.41% in the past one decade, said the KSACS joint director."

The yacht, which he purchased in 2006 and spent £5 million (about Rs 44.5 crore today) refurbishing in 2015, with a 15-seater cinema, spa and steam room, beauty salon and gentleman’s lounge, is currently impounded and moored at Valletta, Malta. The yacht, which boasts four decks and a massive sundeck for entertaining, is where Mallya held some of the most swanky Formula One parties during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, inviting more than 1,000 guests. Built in 2000 by Dutch yard Oceanco for a member of the Qatari royal family, the yacht, estimated to be worth $93 million (about Rs 648 crore), was abandoned by Mallya in Malta in September 2017, allegedly over unpaid maritime bills. The seafarers’ union Nautilus International had the vessel arrested by maritime creditors in March 2018 to recover unpaid wages for more than 40 crew, including Indians, owed more than $1 million (Rs 6.97 crore, approximately) in wages. It was sold in September 2018 at a judicial re-auction as part of the arrest proceedings for €35 million (about Rs 277 crore) to Maltese Society Sea Beauty Yachting Limited and has been renamed “NEOM”. Neom is the name of a new city being built in Saudi Arabia so it is believed the new owner may have links to the Middle East. The vessel, which is registered in the Isle of Man, was abandoned with possessions on board, belonging to both Mallya and his guests, including a grand piano belonging to Elton John and original Picasso and M F Husain paintings. These were part of the auction. Mallya bought the piano, which Elton John had used to write Songs from the West Coast, for €226,000 (about Rs 1.8 crore) at a charity auction in May 2008 in aid of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Barclays Bank is the lead party in the case against the vessel in Malta’s civil court first hall, being the main secured creditor, having lent two mortgages in 2008 and 2018 against it, worth just under €25 million (about Rs 198 crore). Law firm TLT LLP in London, which represents the consortium of 13 Indians banks, secured a court order in the commercial court of the London high court this week to help it get a slice of the yacht’s proceeds. Whilst the banks are not creditors owed money by the yacht, the banks are seeking to secure the net sale proceeds, after the payment of maritime creditors, such as fuel suppliers, who rank in priority. According to the court papers in Malta, which TOI has seen, there are a number of creditors, in addition to Barclays Bank, but the total amount being claimed by all the creditors of the vessel does not exceed €28 million (Rs 221 crore, approximately). The creditors will be paid from the €35 million via a process called a “competition of creditors” procedure. Since there will be a surplus of monies due back to the yacht’s owners, the banks are seeking to obtain that surplus in the Maltese courts rather than it being paid back to the yacht’s previous owner, Mallya. The order, dated November 28, 2018, by Mr Justice Phillips, grants the banks permission to use information provided pursuant to the worldwide freeze order on Mallya’s assets they had obtained in November 2017, in respect of the court proceedings in Malta involving Indian Empress."

Family members of not even 20% of the 8,000 HIV patients registered with ART have undergone the test. In the last few moth’s, four children were detected HIV positive after their parents reluctantly agreed to have them checked. An official from Goa state aids control society (GSACS) said, “Early detection is very important to control the spread of the virus. The disease is a critical, but manageable one, yet those afflicted keep it a secret, not only from the society, but also from their own family, thus, exposing them to the disease.” “It is difficult to accept the reality of testing positive. A majority will try and keep their status hidden,” said a counsellor who works with persons living with HIV/AIDs. The counsellor recounted about the time a 60-year-old woman from Sattari walked into the centre, complaining of severe headache and continuous body pain. The fragile, distressed woman caught the virus from her husband who died a while ago,” the counsellor further said, adding that in many instances, senior citizens infected with the virus are diagnosed late. “In another case, a woman tested positive after the death of her husband, who she had contracted the virus from. She was warned to her get son tested, but she never did so. Recently, her 24-year-old son also tested positive and is believed to have been infected via vertical transmission,” he said. The numbers of people with of HIV are dropping, but it is a matter of concern that carriers of the virus do not take precautions despite warning. “We could do better, only if all co-operate,” he said."

At a TOI event related to the national girl child campaign, she talked about the harassment that the HIV-positive people face in hospitals where they go in search of medication. She said: “My husband refused to go to hospital because laboratory technicians would ask him awkward questions like whether he had any extra-marital affair. The law says the HIV-positive status is not to be disclosed, so why is on the pateints’ medical cards?” She pointed out that the medical term for HIV-positive is “universal precaution”, about which only a few people know. She urged the health department to promote the term so that patients are treated with dignity. Disclosure of their HIV-positive status renders patients vulnerable to harassment at the hands of chemists, who pry into their medical history and personal life. No school is ready to accept her children. Local MP Kirron Kher found it strange that doctors were writing the HIV-positive status on medical cards. She underlined the need to spread awareness about the way the HIV-positive people should be treated, and said laboratory techinicians should correct their mindset. “I ask people to accept HIV/AIDS as a medical problem like cancer.” Pooja’s life changed after she was screened with this medical issue. Not only her in-laws but also her parents denied her financial help for treatment. “Don’t go for the treatment,” her in-laws said, “Society is making fun of us.” This after she lost her husband to the disease. “An HIV-postive person can live a normal life up to 60,” Pooja said. Her in-laws turned her out of the house along with two HIV-postive sons, though they kept her eldest child, who had tested negative. The director of State Aids Control Society supported her treatment and got her life back on track. She now works for the Chandigarh HIV-positive Society. “This medical problem gave me a mission of life,” Pooja said. “To make myself aware of the legal rights of HIV-postitive people, I resumed my education,” she said. She was a matriculate when she got married and completed her graduation after family disowned her. She plans to get a master’s degree in social work and keep working for the rights of HIV-positive people. During the 2010 IPL season, she was “toss ka boss” for a match."

Quoting a recent study by World Health Organisation (WHO), the CM also pointed out that alcohol consumption causes death and disability relatively early in life. “In the age group of 20-39 years, 13.5% of the total deaths in the world were alcohol-related,” Nitish said while addressing a prohibition and excise department’s function here. Referring to the WHO report published on September 21 this year, the CM also pointed out that 5.3% of all deaths in the world in 2016 were due to alcohol consumption. “The adverse effects of alcohol consumption was greater than those of tuberculosis (2.3%), HIV/AIDS (1.8%), diabetes (2.8%), hypertension (1.6%), digestive diseases (4.5%), road injuries (2.5%) and violence (0.5%) across the world,” the CM said. Countering his critics who claim that tourist flow has sharply gone down in Bihar after the enforcement of total prohibition, Nitish said tourist footfall in the state had increased after prohibition and it went above three crore people last year. “More than 10 lakh foreign tourists arrived in the state last year,” he said. Nitish also pooh-poohed his critics’ claim that the state had to suffer a huge revenue loss due to the liquor ban. “We suffered a revenue loss of Rs 1,000 crore only in the first financial year after enforcement of prohibition. After that, the state government received extra revenue and taxes from other heads as the money saved by people after the liquor ban was used in purchase of other consumer items from the market. In that way, people paid more taxes to the government,” the CM said. Praising Nitish for enforcing prohibition in April 2016, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said, “It was not a simple decision. It could be implemented because of the courage shown by the CM.”"

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs are recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) for those in relationships with HIV-positive persons or drug-addicts who have shared needles recently. But doctors told TOI at the sidelights of a medical conference in Nagpur that they were increasingly coming across youths having unprotected sex (without condoms) as they have taken PrEP. “PrEP consumption has gone up drastically as youths do not want barriers like condoms,” infectious diseases specialist Dr J K Maniar, who practices in Mumbai, told TOI. Several doctors at the conference concurred. Infectious diseases specialist doctors told TOI they were wary about PrEP’s availability, and the huge potential of abuse. PrEP has been labelled safe, with a new peer-reviewed medical research published in the medical journal The Lancet stating that it has 99% efficacy if taken properly. But PrEP is a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine drugs. Tenofovir is known to affect kidneys and bone density; users have to take regular blood tests to monitor their kidney and bone health. “PrEP’s efficacy depends on factors such as consumption of alcohol, certain foods and other drugs,’’ said director of infectious diseases at Jaslok Hospital, Dr Om Shrivastav, adding that it’s not a 100% guarantee against HIV. Dr Shrivastav said he knows 40 patients who despite PrEP have got sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes and HIV in the last few years. “PrEP is meant for people with high-risk sexual behaviour who are polygamous. It is recommended they use condoms which, incidentally, too, has a 4% chance of transmitting STDs,’’ he added. India has not yet come up with guidelines on PrEP even though WHO approved its use over a year back. “We don’t want to dilute the focus on the use of condoms to prevent the HIV epidemic,’’ said a senior National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) official. Dr Shrikala Acharya of Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), which works under NACO, said the Centre was estimating the HIV-positive population across major metros to work out PrEP guidelines."

In past several years, only three to five units of HIV infected blood units had been timely detected annually. The rise implies that the number of HIV infected persons are increasing, and also that KGMU has been able to detect infected blood with much more precision by using the specialized Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), than the previously used ELISA testing method to check donated blood for preventing infections via blood transfusion. Speaking at a programme on ‘Safe Blood Transfusion: Need of the Hour’, head of transfusion medicine department at KGMU, Prof Tulika Chandra said, “Blood transfusion runs a direct risk of contracting HIV if the blood is infected. We at KGMU have undertaken NAT since 2012. Since then, of the 3,10,000 units tested by NAT, 2,300 were found to be infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and were thus discarded.” Docs: NAT saved 9k lives by detecting infected blood unitsBut, it is not just 2,300 lives, that KGMU claims to have saved, depending on just conducting NAT on blood. “NAT helped save more than 9,000 lives by detecting 2,300 infected blood units that were discarded since four blood components would have been segregated from each unit, which equals to four patients and any one of this unit can be infected,” said Prof Chandra. She added that the number of HIV infected blood units has grown exponentially while cases of blood infected with Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B have gone down over the years. “There is an urgent need for blood transfusions to be made safe and the government should take note of this fact. Infected blood can be fatal if transfused to an ailing person. There is a phenomena called horizontal transfusion, which means that a person, transfused with infected blood, can give the infection to others in family through sexual and sometimes other means,” she added. Prof Chandra added that KGMU and SGPGIMS are the only centres using NAT while other government hospitals are still using the ELISA testing method. ELISA detects antibodies or antigens produced months after an infection is contracted and is thus futile for recent infections. NAT on the other hand, directly detects DNA or RNA of the infection causing virus present in the blood, making it more accurate."

Some senior medical experts who specialize in STD told TOI that ‘pre-exposure drugs’ are oral medicines that can be taken just hours before sexual intercourse and are known to provide protection against even the deadliest of diseases. Senior dermatologist Dr JK Maniar, who practices in Mumbai, is one of the leading authorities on HIV/AIDS. He says that the success rate of such drugs is very high. “I would say over 99%. So, basically a person can consume this drug and have unprotected sex with an HIV infected person without any medical risk. The consumption of the pre-exposure drugs (PEDs) have gone up drastically as youths do not want any barriers.” Some other senior doctors from Mumbai, all of whom have decades of experience in treating STD patients, too agreed that nowadays patients do not want lectures on morality. Dr. Nina Madani, whose patients are mostly from south Mumbai, said, “We have to accept that lifestyles have changed and it’s a different era now. What we want is that youths should be aware and practice safe sex. In fact, I have so many young girls coming to me and seeking medical consultation for their sex life.” While strictly respecting the doctor-patient confidentiality norms, all of them did share an overall view of the changing sexual habits of people. Dr RD Kharkar said, “It is very common for people to have multiple sexual partners both within and outside of marriage. And patients are very open about it and that is why they are seeking best medical option available to ensure that they are safe even with the lifestyle they live.” Dr Maniar said he is also seeing many gay patients who come to seek advice. “They want to know the level of risk they have with same sex partners and how to prevent it. Multiple sex partners is becoming a reality and in such situation the priority for a doctor is provide good medical advice and that is what the patient is also looking for,” said Mania. Elite sex workers are also increasingly frequenting these top doctors and seeking advice of sexually transmitted infections and diseases. Dr. Madani said, “The trend now being of many not preferring a condom means the chances of infections increase drastically. So everyone wants to know what precautions to take when having multiple sex partners.”"

State directorate of health services data shows that the cases as on November 18, is 473, with 154 cases and five deaths in the 18 days of November 2018 alone. But the figure is much lower than the figure in 2017, with 1,414 cases and 76 deaths. H1N1 was first reported in the state in 2009. ""Increase in the incidence of H1N1 is a national phenomenon. The only way people can spread H1N1 is by coughing and sneezing and the best preventive method is to cover the mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing,"" said Dr Amar Fettle, State Nodal Officer for H1N1. ""Whenever there is rain, we see an increase in H1N1 cases as the infection spreads real fast with a short incubation period,"" said Dr Rajalakshmi Arjun, consultant, Infectious Diseases, KIMS. Health experts say that this increase is reflected even though there is no routine screening for H1N1. The numbers would be much higher if there was regular screening for everyone who comes with symptoms of H1N1, they said. However, Dr Fettle said it is a fallacy that H1N1 should be tested. ""It is impossible to test millions of people with common cold for H1N1 as symptoms are common. Almost 90% come with common cold and don't need investigation or medicine and can manage with supportive care. Very few come with respiratory distress due to pneumonia and treatment needs to be started immediately and one can't wait for the test results,"" said Dr Fettle. What has doctors worried is that the H1N1 strain is continuously changing and due to this the presently available vaccines for H1N1 is not effective. ""We are not able to the identify the present strain causing the disease that majorly affects the respiratory system. We need a strong virology institute in the state to identify the present strain,"" said Dr R C Sreekumar, chairman (Research), Indian Medical Association, Kerala chapter. ""H1N1 is a common disease. In the early stages, people were encouraged to take preventive medicine as it was a rare disease but now the disease is around us in the community and having preventive medicine is barely of any help, unless the person has some high risk condition,"" added Dr Fettle.

The Union government’s national blood transfusion council (NBTC) guidelines state to disqualify donation of blood by a Zika-infected person at least for four months. On the other hand, MP is permitting blood donation after four weeks only. The vector-borne disease has spread its tentacles to one more district— Hardataking the total number of affected districts to eight. On Thursday, 32 samples were tested out of which three were found positive for Zika fever and all positive cases were from Bhopal. “Those, who have been diagnosed for Zika fever, should not be allowed to donate blood for at least one month and those who visited the places affected by Zika should also refrain from blood donation for about two weeks,” said MP health department joint director Dr Rakesh Mushi. He said it to be from an MP health department Zika alert circular issued in 2016. NBTC’s donor selection, referral guidelines and circular issued on October 2017 directed blood banks across the country not to accept blood from people, who have visited Zika-affected or Zikainfected. It states: “In case of Zika infection, defer for four months following recovery. In case of history of travel to endemic Zika virus outbreak zone, the same protocol is followed.” Zika virus is a new challenge for blood transfusion, according to a study published in The Lancet. Unlike other vector-borne ailment like dengue and chikungunya, Zika virus can be spread by blood transfusion and sexual intercourse. With over 100 Zika cases already diagnosed in MP, blood transfusion and possible transmission of Zika is a clear and presents threat, said experts. “As per the protocol, we do not accept a donor, with a history of fever and other recent sickness,” said Gandhi Medical College blood bank in-charge, Dr U M Sharma. The post-surveillance programmes are important to detect Zika virus infections among the blood donors, as surveillance can only detect blood donors with the disease. Currently, a mandatory check for a blood donor does not include Zika infection. Blood donors are checked for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, syphilis and malaria."

Justice C Hari Shankar reversed the trial court’s verdict awarding 10-year jail to the accused, saying it would be a ""travesty of justice"" to convict him of having committed such an “unsolved” crime. The high court, in its 69-page judgement, noted that while the child was HIV positive, accused Amardeep Kujur tested negative and noted that there were allegations that the child was sexually assaulted multiple times. It underlined that the possibility of non-transmission of the HIV virus to the accused would be remote and disagreed with the trial court’s finding that it was not necessary that the HIV virus would, in every case of sexual contact, be transmitted from partner to partner. Justice Shankar observed that the trial judge “ignored the above two facts, apparent from the evidence, i.e., firstly, that the child had suffered mucosal tears in the private parts and, secondly, that the man was alleged to have repeatedly sexually assaulted the child. Sexual contact is, it is well known, the primary mode by which HIV virus is transmitted.” In the judgement, the high court said the mystery of how the assaulter entered the room where the minor was sleeping, and sodomised him day after day, remained unanswered. “The situation, in the present case, remains a classic, and unsolved ‘locked room mystery’, even while the man stands convicted and sentenced (by the trial court).

During the research, antiviral activity of the tamarind seed lectin has been shown by techniques such as luciferase-based assay, plaque reduction assay and real-time PCR. Not only did the chikungunya virus lose 64% of is infectivity on treatment with the lectin, but the levels of viral RNA in the cells were also found to reduce to nearly 45%. The findings have recently been published in the Elsevier journal, Virology. The research group at IIT Roorkee has filed a patent for an antiviral composition containing this tamarind antiviral protein. The researchers are now developing tamarind-based therapeutic agents for chikungunya. Alphaviruses cause mild to severe viral diseases in human beings and animals and are usually transmitted by mosquitoes. The chikungunya virus is an alphavirus that causes high fever and severe joint pain. Professors Shailly Tomar and Pravindra Kumar from the Department of Biotechnology, have shown that a protein found in tamarind seeds has antiviral properties. “Antiviral drugs and vaccines against most alphaviruses, including chikungunya are still not available in the market, and preventive measures are currently the only route to managing diseases caused by such viruses,” said Tomar, on the importance of developing antiviral therapeutics. Chikungunya and other alphaviruses are made of a single strand of RNA that is enveloped in a capsule. The outmost layer of capsule consists of glycoproteins having glycans, a form of sugar. Through these sugar moieties viruses attach to the host cell receptors and enter the cells, causing infections. An antiviral drug that is able to block the interaction of alphaviruses with the host cell and thus should inhibit the virus. In biological systems, antibodies bind to the viral surface glycans (sugar) and glycoproteins and prevent entry of the virus into the host cells. Thus, research on developing antiviral drugs have largely focused on developing sugar-binding molecules that can mimic the action of biological antibodies. Lectin, a diverse group of proteins derived from plant sources, are known to bind to glycan sugars. The use of lectin as antiviral has been extensively studied for a range of viruses, including the HIV and HPV. Tomar and Kumar have shown that a lectin derived from tamarind seeds bind to glycans/ sugar molecules having N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) on the capsule of viruses, thereby preventing the entry of the virus into the host cells. Chikungunya glycoproteins have NAG, which makes the tamarind-derived lectin a promising agent against this virus. “Tamarind is known for various medicinal properties in India and is an excellent Ayurvedic food. The fruits, seeds, leaves and roots bark of the tamarind tree have been used to treat abdominal pain, diarrhoea and dysentery, bacterial infections and parasitic infestations, wounds, constipation and inflammation,” said the researchers. They have isolated lectin from tamarind seeds using chromatography and have studied the binding of the lectin molecules to the glycan in the viral capsule by a process called Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Antiviral activity of the tamarind seed lectin has been shown by techniques such as luciferase-based assay, plaque reduction assay and real-time PCR. Not only did the chikungunya virus lose 64% of is infectivity on treatment with the lectin, but the levels of viral RNA in the cells were also found to reduce to nearly 45%. “This study has, for the first time, evaluated the antiviral use of tamarind seed-derived lectin having specificity for NAG and assessed its ability to block the entry step of the virus,” said Tomar."

The procedure for organ retrieval has been marred with many challenges. To overcome them, two individuals from Nagpur will be placed as medical coordinators in both hospitals, and are expected to start duties from the first week of December. These appointments are part of a pilot project launched by Tata Trusts, Mohan Foundation, and the zonal committee to strengthen organ transplantation in government hospitals. Apart from GMC and Mayo Hospital in Nagpur, GMC Aurangabad, BJMC Pune, and VNGMC Solapur are also part of the project. An MoU in this regard was signed over a month ago between Mohan Foundation, Tata Trusts, and the state government. Highlighting a recent study conducted on challenges in organ retrieval, which was reported by TOI in May, director of Mohan Foundation Dr Ravi Wankhede said there is a shortage of ventilators and dedicated staff to follow-up on brain-death cases. The report by Mohan Foundation and Tata Trusts was presented to minister of medical education Girish Mahajan. GMCH dean Dr Abhimanyu Niswade concedes that there is a paucity of ventilators in GMCH. “Our trauma centre has 23 ventilators and the hospital has a total of 87 ventilators. But we need at least 100 ventilators. Life of a ventilator is only two years. We need 30 new ventilators every year. But last year we received only five for the Trauma Centre,” he said. Some patients come from other states, which makes obtaining consent through counselling impossible, since the main stakeholders are absent, he adds. Mayo Hospital forensic department head Dr Makarand Vyawahare said, “Mayo has no MRI facility yet, so the patient has to be taken outside for the test. Apnoea test is also a mandatory examination for determining brain-death. After this, counselling of the relatives in required.” Talking about other challenges, Mayo anaesthesia head Dr Vaishali Shelgaonkar said, “In many cases of brain-death due to accidents, relatives are not aware of the incident. Until the police find the relatives, the organs of the patient start to deteriorate. Organs of a brain-dead patient can be maintained for maximum 72 hours through additional drugs.” Despite about seven ideal brain-dead cases at Mayo since it received organ retrieval permission in March, and full facilities in the hospital as per norms, organ retrieval has been done only in one case in July. Illiteracy among relatives and inadequate manpower for counselling and paperwork is another challenge, said Dr Shelgaonkar. Brain-dead patients with cancer, HIV, severe infection or above 60 years of age don’t qualify for organ retrieval. Homicidal and poisoning cases also don’t qualify as ideal cases for organ retrieval."

The minor girl has not contracted HIV despite being raped by an infected person from 2008 to 2014 in their house in Sachin area of the city. The convict had divorced his wife to get married to the rape survivor’s mother. He started raping the girl when she was a student of class VI. The girl’s mother was forced to work to support the family because the convict was unemployed. She used to do textile- related job work at home and then went out to sell textile products. The woman’s younger son used to be in school when the convict raped his stepdaughter. He threatened her if she told anyone about it. The girl did not complain to her mother until November 25, 2014 when the convict slapped her alleging that she was having an affair with a man. The girl told her mother that the convict has been raping her since 2008 when she was 10-year-old. The girl’s mother took help of a social worker and approached police, who after registration of the complaint arrested the man and sent him to jail. “The 52-year-old man was convicted for raping his minor stepdaughter and sentenced to 10 years in jail.

The highest prevalence of HIV among TB patients has been recorded by Nagaland (14%), followed by Andhra Pradesh (10%). One of the reasons why Karnataka is in the third position is emphasis given to the testing of HIV status of TB patients, say doctors with the state health and family welfare department. When it comes to total TB patients notified in the country, Karnataka is in the 10th position (81,187). Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 3,11,041 cases. When the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is considered, Uttar Pradesh reports only 1%, indicating poor testing. Bagalkot tops list Bagalkot district tops the list of HIV prevalence among TB patients in Karnataka at 30%. It is followed by Belagavi (15%), indicating that TB care needs to be more focused on north Karnataka. Dharwad, Raichur and Udupi have 11% TB patients suffering from HIV. Dr Ramachandra Bairy, joint director, tuberculosis control programme, health and family welfare department, said early detection helps in controlling the infection. “In Karnataka, all HIV positive persons are tested for TB during their regular monthly antiretroviral therapy (ART) sessions. Likewise, all TB patients are tested for HIV infection,” he said. If people living with HIV have cough that persist for more than two weeks and develop any gland in neck, they are immediately referred for TB testing, he added."

Under the guidance of the HoD of geriatrics, Mangala Borkar, and associate professor Shailaja Rao, Rajan had undertaken research on HIV positive cases first diagnosed in the geriatric age. The annual conference of the Geriatric Society of India (GSI), GSICON, was jointly organized by the Pune chapter of the Society and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune on the theme ‘getting old is mandatory, feeling old is optional’. International faculty Tahir Masud and the general secretary of the GSI, OP Sharma, were present. Rajan presented a paper on the retrospective study done, which was based on the records of the ART PLUS Centre at GMCH, to assess the clinical profile of newly-diagnosed HIV positive geriatric patients. Explaining the study, the PG student says that the HIV infection is common in the younger age group (under 45 years). However, there are geriatric patients who are HIV positive. “Some may have being diagnosed in their late 40s or 50s and are surviving in their 60s due to good management. A few may have been diagnosed for the first time at the age of 60 or above. This study consists of the latter group,” Rajan states. The paper states that many older individuals lack knowledge about safe sex and perceive themselves to be at a low risk. “The testing rate among them is lower and they often present at a late stage. Drug therapy of both age related co-morbidities and HIV can increase the side effects.” The study shows that 2.96% patients were diagnosed for HIV for the first time at a geriatric age. “Many elderly individuals may be sexually active and need to be educated about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in a tactful and discreet manner,” the research concludes. Mahesh Patil and Zeba Firdous contributed to the study. Patil had also presented a poster on the screening of geriatric patients for dementia at the event."

When the vacation bench comprising justice S Vaidyanathan and justice PT Asha commenced proceedings, two advocates made a mention of the case. The advocates -- George Williams and Krishnamoorthy -- moved an urgent motion about the blood transfusion and sought the court to take suo motu cognisance of the issue. Williams submitted that he would like to bring the matter to the notice of the court and was not willing to file any petition. The Bench then said it would like to take suo motu cognisance and issued notice to the health secretary seeking a status report on the incident and action taken against the errant officials by January 3. On December 3, the woman visited the Sattur government hospital for antenatal checks where she was advised blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days after the procedure, it came to light that the blood transfused was HIV positive and was negligently labelled safe by the hospital's lab technicians. Originally, the blood was donated by a teenager which was meant to be transfused to his relative. But, since it was not used, it was stored in the blood bank. Immediately after the issue was brought to the notice of the authorities, three health workers of the blood bank at the government hospital in Sivakasi were placed under suspension for labelling the HIV positive blood as safe. On further inquiry, it was found the hospital authorities had found that the donor was affected by HIV as early as 2016 when he donated blood at a camp in Sattur. But as the teenager was out of town when a counsellor phoned him to inform, he was asked to report to the hospital as early as possible.

The woman has lodged a complaint against unknown doctors and nurses for the transfusion and sought stringent action against them. The government has arranged all facilities at the Madurai government hospital and sacked three employees for the tragic mix-up. But there is evidence to show public health care officials had at least two chances to prevent the tragedy. For one, the donor had been identified as HIV positive two years ago, in 2016, when he donated blood at a camp in Sattur in Virudhunagar district. The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at the government hospital there should have told the youth he had HIV. The counsellor did call him up but only told him to report to the centre. Counsellors normally do not break the news over phone. But the counsellor she did not pursue the case when he did not turn up . Second, the blood bank staff could have prevented the catastrophe had they tested the blood he donated on November 30, again at the Sattur government hospital. The lab technician labelled it safe and a woman and her unborn child are paying for his negligence. It had been issued to a woman at the Sivakasi GH on December 3. The woman had come to the GH for antenatal checks. Doctors told her that she had to undergo blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days later, a private hospital in Madurai tested the donor positive for HIV and referred him to Sattur GH.

"136","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/rehana-fathima-is-no-pilgrim/articleshow/66289668.cms",2018-10-20,"By J DevikaEver since chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared CPM’s commitment to Kerala’s unique legacy of enlightened Hinduism on the Sabarimala issue, I have been wondering about the relative absence of CPM’s mass organization of women, whose membership runs into lakhs. I have firsthand knowledge that very many of its members are devout Hindus. If CPM were serious about drawing upon this legacy, I wondered, why is it that they are not making an active effort to encourage these women (and devout men in their other mass organizations) to embrace the Supreme Court’s valiant effort to ensure gender equality in the Hindu faith? Why is it not actively campaigning within its fold that undertaking the Sabarimala pilgrimage at this crucial moment in history is a key gesture of self-respect for female devotees? If CPM would have done that, we would not have been subject to this extremely painful sight of women trying to make it to the shrine, only to be violently ejected by criminals, hooligans and frenzied women, all emboldened by the brazen takeover of public space there by Hindutva elements. Definitely, CPM could have made sure that believers in their fold, male and female, made it to the shrine safe and sound. If so, stray ‘activists’ need not have risked their lives. I do not know if Rehana Fathima, a young woman who has often cocked a snook at conservative gender/sexual norms, who attempted the pilgrimage on Friday, was deliberately set up by Hindutva elements to create the impression that the shrine was in the danger of being sullied by ‘bad/women’ who are also non-Hindu. I don’t know if minister Kadakampally Surendran’s intervention was really to avert violence. Even if his intervention was really to that end, his indignant pronouncement that Sabarimala was not a playground for ‘activists’ did irreversible harm. In itself, there is nothing wrong with Rehana’s action: the Supreme Court permits women’s entry now and tradition does not bar people of other faiths from visiting the shrine. There are no standards established to measure the intensity of belief; even if they do exist, they are not applied to potential male pilgrims. It may indeed be the case that there were good reasons for the minister to stop Rehana. My point is, however, about the discourse he couches it in, which turns it into an affront against ‘believers’. This is not mitigated by his shrewd choice of words – ‘activist’, instead of ‘Muslim-born’, or ‘wayward woman’. One is even persuaded to think that CPM and BJP have arrived at a resolution of this chicken-game-like situation in which neither party can turn back without suffering loss of face. The resolution involves setting up an ‘other’ around which ‘true believers’ may consolidate themselves, the constituency of BJP, but one which CPM would like to woo too. Kadakampally’s offended tone directed at the ‘activist’ would help CPM do exactly this as it conveys a commitment to the purity of the shrine, even as it continues to encourage the ‘believing’/ ‘good’ woman! The stance adopted by CPM supporters – that they do not ask any woman to visit the shrine, only ensure a safe pilgrimage for any woman who chooses to go – creates the impression that there are no believers among them and therefore the toil of democratizing the Hindu community does not fall on them. This allows them to keep their mainstream Hindu base more or less invisible, exempt themselves from the burden of shaping new believers from within, and at the same time, keep up the appearance of neutrality in matters of religious faith. Nevertheless, they do want to gain from the social momentum unleashed by the Supreme Court judgment. Hence the goodcop bad-cop game: Pinarayi thunders about the legacy of Kerala’s social democratization in general (or Kodiyeri Balakrishnan defends ‘activists’); Kadakampally reacts in harsh tones against the specific instance of a ‘women’s activist’ trying to make hay while the sun shines. Kadakampally keeps his liberal-Hindu image, of one who supports ‘true women of the faith’ and simultaneously signals his commitment to the ‘purity of Sabarimala.’ The scapegoat in this sordid game is the ‘activist’ woman, a figure feared by both Hindutva right wing and Left-wing mainstream. There can be little doubt that these ‘activist’ women have caused these authorities the greatest worry in recent years. From sex workers to nuns, teagarden labourers to glamorous film stars, from the delicate-looking but steelwilled Hadiya to fearless young dalit women students, they have repeatedly, persistently, challenged the mainstream consensus on gender justice and social order – despite, mind you, the combined might of the police, the lower judiciary, caste leaders, community authorities, school principals, tearful parents, armies of hostile relatives, sexual offenders in offices, foul-mouthed male hordes online. Maybe history will treat Kadakampally’s reference as a compliment, albeit oblique. The writer is a scholar and author."

For at least a decade, none had dared target a bank in this manner. The cops are apprehensive that the successful day-time heist may have removed the fear of potential robbers of being nabbed on the bank premises by the customers and employees or of being surrounded by police alerted via secret alarms. The cops were able to recall only two bank-related crimes in the past few years, both burglaries carried out in at night. In the first incident in August last year, three thieves managed to sneak into Syndicate Bank in Mukherjee Nagar through the window. Taking advantage of the weekend closure, the men managed to hack the window grilles to enter the building. They made away with Rs 2.3 lakh worth of coins in 46 polythene bags. The cops, however, did not have to pursue the intruders for long and nabbed them within 48 hours. In the second incident on December 22, 2017, the three men involved dug a tunnel to the Cooperative Bank in outer Delhi's Mundka from a vacant adjacent plot. Armed with gas cutters and cylinders, they drilled a hole in the wall, entered the building one by one and disabled the CCTV cameras and the security alarm. The trio took away the CCTV footage recorders along with around Rs 30 lakh in cash and some jewellery having broken into at least 15 lockers. The cops arrested the three men after a month of investigation. Rather than break-ins of this sort, robbing of cash vans has been more common in the city these last five years or so. The criminals take advantage of the fact that cash companies often ferry large amounts of money to and from banks without providing police with prior information. In April this year, for instance, robbers shot dead two and fled with Rs 12 lakh from a cash van. Some incidents have involved the employees of the cash replenishment firms. They were caught stealing cash while refilling ATMs. However, an armed robbery was an unheard of for a lengthy period. For a city that is under constant terror threat, Friday's incident can set a precedent and encourage criminals and terrorists to execute similar capers to fund their gang and illegal activities. The Delhi Police brass has asked joint commissioners and deputy commissioners to take steps in this regard and conduct meetings with bank officials to sensitise them about the security measures that need to be taken to avert robberies."

The numerous potholes, ruts in the road and loose gravel dislodged by the steady traffic are the cause. Bahal has been using the road for several years now. The potholes re-appear almost immediately after repairs are undertaken, he said. “I have been travelling along this road for eight years, first, to go to college and now for work. The patch around Command Hospital near the Armed Forces Medical College is a big problem. The road is waterlogged even after a light shower and even if repaired the road gets damaged quickly. It is a big inconvenience for hundreds of commuters. Loose gravel at many spots spreads by the day on the road posing a threat to motorists, especially two-wheeler riders,” he said. Bahal added that good quality repairs and a permanent solution is a must to improve the road conditions. Other commuters from the area have questioned the quality of repairs undertaken in the patch due to the recurring potholes year on year. Wanowrie resident Yuvraj Chaudhary said, “ Potholes appear at the same spots as the previous year. The road condition from outside The Bishop’s School to the Prince of Wales Drive has deteriorated over the years despite repairs. There are huge potholes outside this school, St Mary’s School, at the St Mary’s Church junction and beyond the signal too. Thousands of children commute daily on this road and the condition of the road poses a risk to all of them.” Petrol dealer Ali Daruwalla, who has his petrol pump in the area, said he has often seen two-wheelers skid due to the gravel on the road. “The condition of the road is deplorable and no one has taken any cognizance of the situation. Some day there may be a huge accident. Before it happens, the authorities must wake up. The road needs to be repaired as people are skidding and getting hurt. Authorities must take responsibility for the road and get work done at the earliest to avert any major accident,” he said. Chief executive officer of Pune Cantonment Board DN Yadav said, “The road is under maintenance by Military Engineering Services. We cannot undertake repairs on this road.” The stretch comes under Garrison Engineer (south) and Garrison Engineer (north). “We have carried out a post-monsoon survey of the stretch. But, we could not commence the repair work as the budgetary allocation has not been sanctioned as yet,” a senior defence official told TOI on Saturday."

But their HIV-positive status has turned them into social pariahs, with the city offering them no space to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. Out to open their own café called “Cafe Positive”, all they have met with for the last three months is a big negative. No house-owner in some of south Kolkata’s posh localities has been willing to rent out space once told about “who will manage and run the shop”. While a few landlords have straightaway refused saying “e paray erom cholbena (such business won’t run in this neighbourhood)”, others have been courteous enough with financial help and old clothes, but pleaded helplessness in renting out space to the 18-plus teens. The NGO funding the café and trying to find a 750sqft space has approached over a dozen owners since December at locations like Golpark, Dover Lane, Lake Road, Hindustan Park and Purna Das Road. “We have been looking for a suitable space for the café since December and approached a number of house-owners directly and through brokers. The owners initially seemed excited at the concept, but the moment they learnt that the shop will be managed and run solely by HIV-positive children, they backed out,” said Kallol Ghosh, founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children. TOI spoke to two house-owners, one at Lake Road and the other at Dover Lane. “I would not mind renting out space to them. But we live in a joint family and some members have objections. I could not convince them, so I rejected the offer,” said a landlady. The house-owner at Dover Lane, too, blamed her neighbours and family. “I don’t know how people in our neighbourhood would react to it. I know there are many misconceptions associated with HIV. I don’t think I am in a position to convince everyone. Moreover, I have now decided to rent the space to a boutique and not an eatery,” he said. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2017 defines what can count as discrimination against HIV-positive people. It lists that denial or discontinuation of employment, education, healthcare services, renting or residing property, standing for public or private office will count as discrimination along with unfair treatment in any of the above mentioned categories. The shelter at Narendrapur is home to around 70-odd young patients and this café project is part of an initiative to make a group self-sufficient. The NGO will give the initial funds and later hand over the management of the café to the 10 boys and girls, who would be running it. “We have been undergoing training at this shelter and can’t wait to start our café. We know the disease we suffer from and how it spreads or what precautions we need to take. But strangely, the adults don’t understand that HIV doesn’t spread through touch and often hesitate to even shake hands with us,” said Susanta Pal (name changed), a Class XII student who was diagnosed with HIV when he was just 5. “HIV does not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing food/drink, toilet seats, sweat, touching, sneeze/cough or through insect bites. We also want society to know about these from our café. But for that, we first need an opportunity,” said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies. According to the plan, food and beverages at the 750sqft ground-floor café will be served on disposable plates and there will be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding. “We are not looking for any exceptions or rebate and are ready to pay as per the existing market rate but even then not a single house-owner is ready,” lamented Ghosh."

Speaking at a panel discussion on ‘Homosexuality: Changing attitude: Supreme Court and Society’, organized by Press Club of Nagpur in the wake of the historic Supreme Court judgment to decriminalize gay sex. “Though section 377 has been struck down, there still exists a social stigma around homosexuals and transgenders. This could be wiped out by creating awareness as people usually confuse gender with sexuality. Like heterosexuals, our sexuality or sexual orientation is part of our personal life none of which should define us,” said Joshi. LGBTQ community should also start wearing their sexuality on sleeves and shed inhibitions of being different, he added. Transgender activist Vidya Kamble, former major and HIV specialist Dr Milind Bhrushundi, MLA Dr Milind Mane and social activist Girish Gandhi participated in the discussion. Talking about transgenders’ rights, Kamble said, “Today, we are struggling for facilities as basic as a public toilet. We don’t have basic identification documents and it becomes the basis of rejection on professional front. The SC has passed the judgment but the ground reality is different. The government should extend benefits and include us in education schemes,” she said. “We have a population of 750 transgenders in the city and proper education and a little support from the society will help us earn daily bread,” she added. Dr Bhrushundi spoke about issues a homosexual faces while growing up and the positive effect of the judgment in curbing HIV. “A person growing up with different sexual orientation is not just confused about himself but fears facing the society due to stigma. This makes it twice as difficult for him to accept himself and takes a toll on his mental health,” he said. He said, “HIV is mainly prevalent in two sections of the society — heterosexuals aged between 15-25 years and in LGBTQ community. Fortunately, it has now become easier for us to identify the affected persons and curb it disease. It is easier for homosexuals to accept their ailment,” said Bhrushundi."

The captain looked him up and down, and said “I don’t play with beginners.” Eight months later, Alexander was ranked fourth in the Delhi championships, and he had defeated the captain twice. “In college, all I wanted to do was play chess. My academic record was good, but my chess performances were better. I even considered dropping out of college in my third year, to play chess full time, but better counsel prevailed,” he laughs. Alexander’s father was PC Alexander, the IAS officer who later became Indira Gandhi’s principal secretary, the governor of Tamil Nadu and then Maharashtra, and was proposed by AB Vajpayee’s government as their nominee for president of India. His presidency was opposed by the Congress party. “My father’s career saw many highs, but it also saw some tremendous lows. Even back then, there were times when his career was almost wrecked. And though it was my father’s fond hope that I would follow in his footsteps and become an IAS officer, I was sure that I did not want to get into government service. A number of things happened which convinced me that I did not want to be at the mercy of politicians – and frankly, I did not want to be a bureaucrat. I wanted to avoid the IAS at all costs,” Alexander laughs. There were other experiences that shaped the young Alexander when he was growing up. In 1963, his father was posted to New York, working at the UN. The family moved with him, and they stayed there for four years. “I still remember the dates,” says Alexander. We landed in New York on October 15th, 1963. On 22 November, that year, President John F Kennedy was assassinated. Less than three months later, The Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan show,” he says. Alexander went to an international school in New York, growing up when the country was undergoing a period of dramatic social change. It was the time of the Vietnam War – with carnage on TV every night. It was the time of student protests against the war. It was a time of flower power and the British invasion, with bands like the Rolling Stones and the Kinks and the Animals and the Yardbirds dominating the charts. And it was also the time of the space race, as the US and the USSR vied for supremacy, and the Indian teen covered his wall with posters of astronauts and spacecraft. But those days had to come to an end. In 1967, PC Alexander decided to return to India. “He was bored. He was finishing his work for the day in two to three hours. And this was anathema to a man who worked almost to the point of collapse when he was in India,” says Alexander. “I was shocked,” he says. Then, he pauses, and reflects. “My father’s career is full of incidents where he gave up what was a comfortable, well paying position, to take up something that he felt he had to do. The pattern seems to have repeated itself in my life as well,” he says. After completing his economics degree from St Stephens, Alexander followed it up with a masters from the Delhi School of Economics, and a Postgraduate Diploma in Management from IIM, Ahmedabad. From IIMA, Alexander joined Price Waterhouse, and did well there. He was posted to Hong Kong, but work still took second place to chess. “It was at one of those chess competitions that I met someone who was working for McKinsey. Now, people who play chess have a reputation for intelligence, but few people realize that chess intelligence doesn’t translate well to real life,” he says, with a twinkle in his eye. “But this person convinced me that I would fit in well at McKinsey. So I applied, flew down to New York, attended a series of interviews and was selected,” he says. But it wasn’t smooth sailing at McKinsey for Alexander. “I was assigned to a project on reinsurance, and I didn’t know anything about it. I also did not get along well with my engagement manager, and at the end of the year, I got a report which began with the words “Good news”, but also included the line “He still has to demonstrate that he has the ability and virtue of teamwork required to succeed in the Firm”. I was quite happy with the report, but when I showed it to others — including my father — their reaction was one of shock. “This means that you are going to be fired if this happens again,” said a colleague. That was the beginning of a dark period for Alexander, but he slowly changed the negative first impression by working tirelessly on a project that no one else wanted, working through a freezing Colorado winter. As his reputation turned around, he also began evangelizing the idea of a McKinsey operation in India. “It was clear that my IIM classmates were as good, if not better that the Harvard types that worked in McKinsey in those days.” McKinsey set up shop in India just as liberalization transformed the country’s economy, and Alexander thrived, ultimately heading the consultancy’s operations in Delhi. And then, Bill Gates visited India. The Gates Foundation was attempting to tackle the problem of HIV, and Alexander accompanied him. Fascinated with the scope of the problem, he left McKinsey to join the Gates Foundation in India. During his nine years as the head of the Gates Foundation in India, he designed and implemented the highly regarded Avahan programme. “Working with the Gates Foundation, I realized that the money, the glamour, all of that was an illusion. I realized that I had to give something back. I really wasn’t prepared for what I would see on the ground. The poverty, the terrible state of a country that I hadn’t really been aware of. It changed me. Some things that I took from McKinsey were my training in problem identification and solving, and it is something that is lacking in many areas of the social sector. Now, Alexander is running his own NGO, the Antara foundation, which works on improving maternal and child health outcomes. “It’s a far cry from working with the Gates Foundation. There we disbursed 370 million dollars over ten years. Now I’m grateful for a donation of a few lakh rupees,” he says. He stops, and thinks for a few seconds. “It’s the steepest learning curve that I have ever encountered he says. But that’s what keeps me going.”"

Police commissioner K Venkatesham told TOI on Saturday, “We have arrested the railway engineer entrusted with the task of removing the hoarding frame on its premises (railway land). We have launched a hunt for the contractor who cut the hoarding frame. We are still probing the case and depending upon the outcome, more action will be taken.” Senior inspector M Mujawar of the Bund Garden police said, “Our investigation is focused on identifying the railway authorities, who gave the contract, those who were monitoring the work and those responsible for the security of people. We have sought documents from the railway authorities related to the contract and allied details, and will examine the same.” Mujawar further said, “The railway authorities had given the contract to remove the hoarding frame to a private contractor, who is at large with his employees. Our team visited the residences of the contractor and his employees, but they were not there at home.” On the probe related to how the accident occurred, Mujawar said, “The frame came crashing down on the autorickshaws and other vehicles on the road with a huge force. The contractor’s employees had started dismantling the metal frame directly from the bottom instead of removing the upper parts of the structure first. They tied a rope to the metal frame and tried to pull it down towards the railway land. But something went wrong, and the frame swung towards the opposite direction and fell on the road with a catapult effect.” The railway authorities did not follow the due diligence, Mujawar said. “They could have halted the vehicular movement on the road for a few minutes while removing the structure or executed the task in the night.” CP meets civic chief Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham and Pune municipal Corporation (PMC) chief Saurabh Rao had a meeting on Saturday on illegal hoardings in the city. “I assured my full support to the civic admininstation in its drive against illegal hoardings.

More than 12 years ago, their village had hit headlines for reporting a large number of HIV positive cases in a health camp. The incident had lent Udai Sarai a negative image, feel its residents, some of them relieved that the tag is now for Bangarmau’s villages. “Whenever I told people I was from Udai Sarai, they used to quickly check if it was the same HIV village that made news a few years ago. Though I was embarrassed, I had to accept the truth,” said former village head Dhanraj. “The Unnao villages’ incident is unfortunate,” he added, referring to the case where a quack had infected 58 people with a syringe. “But things will change if people determine. Take the case of our village, no new HIV case has been reported in Udai Sarai for a few years. This will help us shun the bad image,” he added. Awareness measures have helped Udai Sarai stay HIV-free for 5 years ‘Women spearheading change by discussing prevention’ In the detection in 2005, 52 people had tested positive for HIV. Of them, 48 have died while the remaining are on anti-retroviral therapy. The village, barely 18km from a government hospital, was home to around 500 families at that time. At least one member from each was working in Maharashtra or Gujarat. With migrant population believed to be a major reason for the virus, HIV came to be known as ‘Mumbai wali bimari’ here. Today, 90% of the 700 houses in the village have someone working in Maharashtra but no new case has been reported in the past five years. Women have driven the change by openly talking about prevention, claim health activists and officials. Caution has become their second nature. “Women maketheir husbands get themselves tested for HIV at least once a year,” said Vidya Devi, who was a newly wed in 2005. Anganwadi worker Gyan Swaroopa has been a hero of HIV prevention by counselling the women. Breaking barriers of shame and harassment—there is fear of being teased by men for talking about sex—she speaks openly to every boy who heads to Mumbai. “Isme kahekisharam... jaan hai to jahan hai (Why be ashamed of doing my duty. Health and survival are the most important),” she reasons. As a result, the air of stigma around HIV is absent in this village. “You can pose direct questions on HIV here unlike in other villages. In fact, HIV testing is considered even at the onset of a simplefever,” saidRajendra Sahu of Nehru Yuva Sangathan Tisi, a social organisation working to create awareness around HIV/ AIDS. Village head Jagatpal said: “The men have been told to have sex only with their wives. The elders keep an eye on the behaviour of their children. Those in Mumbai keep an eye on each other and ensure that no one gets deviated. Medical advice is taken for every disease. Even a simple fever is not ignored and HIV testing is done.” “No HIV positive case has been reported from this village in five years,” said Dr SP Jauhari, secretary of the district aids control society. However, HIV cases in Fatehpur district have continued to rise. Against 97 cases in 2014, 163 cases were reported in 2017. January alone this year has seen 27 cases, data from the health department shows."

They claim the revelation turned their lives upside down, causing them mental agony and pushing them into depression. Halappa KB, 60, and Sushmitha, 21, are residents of Davanagere. Halappa, a labourer, got admitted to City Central Hospital in December 2017 for acute leg pain, followed by blockage in his veins. He alleged that no consent was taken from him for the HIV test nor was he informed while his blood was being drawn. His son Raju H is now running from pillar to post seeking justice and has complained to the consumer court as well, claiming that his father had to face stigma due to the false positive reports. “The hospital conducted an HIV test without our knowledge and consent. It claimed that the report was positive and refused to conduct cardiac surgery on my father. He slipped into depression and even attempted suicide. We brought him to a private hospital in Bengaluru and got him tested for HIV. But the report was negative and he even underwent the operation. My complaint to the health department has been ignored and justice has been delayed,” Raju told TOI. Sushmitha had visited the Davanagere hospital in March for a prenatal check-up when she was five months pregnant. “The blood test was done on March 23. But they asked us to collect the report after three days. We were shocked with the findings — they showed she was HIV-positive — and underwent stress and psychological trauma,” said her husband Prahlad S, a police constable. The couple then went to the government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre for HIV testing. Till then, they had no idea that the report issued by the private hospital was false. “ICTC’s report revealed Sushmitha was not HIV-positive, which came as a huge relief. But the private hospital was firm on its stand. If they had a doubt, they should have conducted another test,” said Prahlad. Sushmitha’s medical negligence complaint with the health department is pending inquiry. Prahlad added that the hospital didn’t even bother to counsel them when they were traumatised after seeing the report. Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere, said he was asked by the district health officer to inquire into both the complaints. “In Halappa’s case, the inquiry report has been submitted to the government, but the findings can’t be disclosed. In the other case, the inquiry is yet to begin,” he said. Cases pending before court: HospitalWhen TOI contacted the hospital authorities, they refused to comment but neither denied nor admitted to the allegations. “The cases are pending before the consumer court. At this stage, we can’t comment on the complaints. We have cooperated with the health department for the inquiry,” said Padmanabh UR, administrator, City Central Hospital. ‘Negligence cases not under KPME Act’In 2017, the state witnessed a series of protests by doctors when the government initiated amendments to the Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (KPME) Act to regulate private medical establishments. Though the amendments were made, they were called the watered-down version of those intended. In the two cases, the patients have sought action under the KPME Act. “But the Act authorises us only to check and take measures if a hospital/clinic is functioning without registration. Medical negligence cases don’t come under it,” said Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere."

Despite the remarkable progress made in advancing HIV science, stigma and discrimination which is founded on the fear surrounding the early AIDS pandemic in the 1980s continues to persist to this day,” says founder, Human Touch Foundation, Peter Borges. The consequences of stigma and discrimination are invariably devastating, he adds, stating that some people are shunned by family, friends, community and society, while others face poor treatment in healthcare and education settings, violation of their human rights, and psychological damage. “These push people living with HIV and key populations further underground, limiting their access to HIV prevention, testing, treatment and other lifesaving health services,” he says.

She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004. She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve. She aborted the child and confronted her husband, who ran a hotel. “After initial hesitance, he accepted his relationships with multiple partners,” said Meena, whose son is 27 now, and HIV negative. There was no ‘happily ever after’ in Meena’s life with her husband, but today she helps the people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Chandigarh find love. She has married off eight of them. Her face lights up at announcing that barring one, the rest of the couples are proud parents of HIV-negative children. “Of the myths about the disease, one is that the babies born to a mother with HIV also test positive,” Meena said. “People are unaware that if the mother and her baby receive proper medication during pregnancy and after birth, the chances of it are very less.” Network of friendsMeena is a member of the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, or CNP+ for short. She is also a peer counsellor of Vihaan, a CNP+ programme. Network’s president Pooja Thakur was shunned by her in-laws when she tested positive along with her two sons a decade ago. Her eldest son, however, is HIV negative. Her husband died of AIDS. Pooja dared to go public about her HIV status in order to work for HIV awareness and counselling. Her positive attitude towards life rubbed on to several women and gave them the courage to live. One of them is today a member of Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS), CNP+, and Vihaan. She joined the network in 2007 after losing her husband to AIDS. She could move to Chandigarh with her four children because of a supportive brother. Created in November 2005, CNP+ meets on the 25th of every month, for tasks such as introducing new members, following up on the missed cases, and linking the members with ART centres. Today, the network has 1,000-plus registered members, who pay an annual subscription of Rs 100. CNP+ and Vihaan participate in many programmes of the state society. “We tell the PLHIV to visit the 12 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in Chandigarh for free testing. We ask people to practice safe sex,” said Rahul, HIV+ve for more than 10 years. DiscriminationMeena said: “More important than fighting the disease is to fight the social stigma that keeps people from sharing their HIV status with family and taking treatment. We share our life stories with these people to boost their morale. We are living examples that with proper medication and diet, one can live with this virus for years,” said Meena, HIV +ve for 24 years. The PLHIVs live as outcasts. Family and friends discriminate against them, while even doctors judge them. Pooja asked for countrywide order for the doctors and clerks to write “universal precaution” instead of “HIV positive” on their hospital cards, “so that the chemists don’t look at us differently when they see the stamp”. ‘Admit our kids’“If our identity is revealed, our children won’t get admission in schools,” said a member of the network, seeking government support for a home for HIV-positive children and a higher monthly pension for widows and children from the present Rs 1,000 and Rs 700, respectively. Ask Pooja about the free bus pass in Chandigarh for PLHIVs and she has a hearty laugh. “For seven years, no progress,” she said."

Since a very small proportion of the cases detected in the private sector are not notified and brought to the notice of the government, he said it is high time that private and public sector join hands to eliminate TB in the state. “Goa has a strong private sector which is 50:50. Many TB patients prefer private doctors, as first point of contact, because of privacy issue. We need strong support from our colleagues in the private sector, in notifying such TB cases,” he stated during the state launch of Joint Effort to Eliminate TB (JEET) at Panaji. Notified patients will be offered drugs free of cost supplied by WHO qualified pharma companies which undergo stringent quality check mechanisms. Notified patients will also be provided with associated services like HIV testing, multi drug resistance testing, counseling and chemo prophylaxis he stated. While De Sa highlighted the problem of undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed and treated TB, he said the emergence of a deadly form of the disease i.e drug resistant TB is a bigger worry. “TB spreads very easily because it is airborne and there is already a threat of this drug resistant TB spreading,” he stated. He also added that the government of India recently launched a social support scheme to help all TB patients by offering them Rs 500 each month for the entire duration of their treatment i.e 6-8 months and for multi drig resistant TB- 2 years. Around 300 patients in the state have availed of this scheme he stated. The JEET project aims for intensive engagement of private sector to achieve universal access to quality diagnosis and treatment for TB and help the nation in achieving The National Strategic Plan to eliminate TB by 2025."

""People are investing in research park, innovation cells, but we don't see any funding coming our way...We do not even have enough seed funding to work on our ideas,"" she said. Bharat, who was the deputy director (academics) at TISS, was holding additional charge as the director for over six months, after S Parasuraman retired in February. Speaking about the challenges faced by the premier institute, Bharat said the financial situation is not so good and they would need support from various sources. ""We are reaching out to people. It is matter of converting all the good wishes to actual funds. Many have shown interest and we are getting money, but it is nowhere close to what we need."" The shortage of funds in social sciences' sector paints a worrying picture for institutes like TISS. TISS had competed for the Institutes of Eminence tag from the MHRD but lost out to other institutes despite having the highest NAAC rating in the country. It was granted grade-I autonomy status recently. ""The challenge now is to consolidate what we already have and do quality research, and work with communities and disadvantaged groups... More importantly, we want to evaluate the impact of our work. We will have to see what more needs to be done and how,"" Bharat said. Though physical expansion of the campus is not on cards, she intends to start courses where there is a possibility of revenue generation. ""People are keen to have a degree from TISS. We will have to acc- ordingly design courses based on the need of the industry."" The new director is keen on bringing some stability across their campuses. ""Students have raised a few issues in the recent past, which are importa- nt. There have been some problems (referring to the recent protests over scholarships) but we have commenced work to augment our endowments and to get more scholarships and more fellowships for them. There is a shortage, but we are trying to raise funds and support many more students. It may not exactly match their demands, but we are making a sincere effort,"" said Bharat. For the last two years, UGC has been hinting at the closure of few centres, including the ones working on social exclusion and inclusive policies, women's studies and human rights. ""We are constantly in dialogue with the UGC and we are hoping for a positive outcome,"" she said. From research point of view, she said she would continue to work on her projects in the health sector, like studying the impact of counselling on health systems and self-testing for HIV."

Mukesh* of Premganj is one of them. His elder sister was engaged to a man from the neighbouring Hardoi district and the family happily making arrangements for the wedding. But the would be in-laws of his sister have stopped taking their calls since the news of HIV infections in Premganj and two adjoining villages made headlines. When Mukesh tried to contact them through a mediator, they called off the match. “No one in my family is infected, but moving away seems to be the only option left for us. Otherwise who will marry my siblings, including four sisters?” Mukesh asked. Shivam (45), a class-IV civic employee, lives with his mother (80). Both tested negative for HIV, but he feels ostracised by relatives. Life is no better at work either. “My colleagues have started ignoring me,” he said. Ratnesh (28) tested positive and is devastated. A Class VIII dropout, he lives with his two sisters and parents in Premganj and works as a “palledar” in Galla Mandi. “A grocer refused to sell things to me. My friend has suggested I shift from here. I know the time has come to leave Premganj,” he said. However, Unnao chief medical officer S P Chowdhary said there was no need for panic.

Reports of a quack in Uttar Pradesh infecting 58 people with HIV by using infected needles have shaken the MP government into the need to monitor quacks, who roam around the hinterland posing as doctors. The health department issued fresh guidelines to all district chief medical and health officers (CMHO) on Wednesday to rein in these frauds. What adds to the worry is that Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society does not list these cases in its HIV sentinel surveillance. As per MPSACS data, there are 7,021 intravenous drug users being monitored at their anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. Sources say 28 of them (0.4%) were infected with HIV due to the behavioural practices of addicts — sharing needles. The data does not say if the infection was attributed to quacks. “We target high-risk population and the data is year-marked. Unqualified doctors will be monitored and action will be taken against them. Fresh instructions to this effect have been issued on Wednesday,” said MPACS project direct Umesh Kumar. “Crackdown on quacks is a law and order problem. From the standpoint of the health department, only the chief health officer can recommend action to the district administration,” he added. However, the health department could not provide ready data on action initiated against quacks in 51 districts of MP. The number of HIV/AIDS patients in MP is 0.09% of the population — less than national adult prevalence of 0.27% (2013). In 2016, NACO reported 44,427 AIDS patients in MP. Quacks exploit the lacunae in healthcare in MP. The state has about 4,500 MBBS doctors for the health department whereas WHO estimates say there is a need for at least 15,000 more."

In India, the consumption of alcohol has increased from 2.4 litres in 2005 to 5.7 litres in 2016 with 4.2 litres being consumed by men and 1.5 litre by women, it said. The total alcohol per capita consumption (15+ years) is expected to increase in half of the WHO regions by 2025 and the highest increase is expected in the southeast Asia Region. An increase of 2.2 litres is expected in India alone which represents a large proportion of the total population in this region, the report highlighted. However, increases, although smaller, are also expected in Indonesia and Thailand (with the second- and fourth-largest largest populations). The second-highest increase is projected for the populations of the Western Pacific Region, where the population of China is the largest, with an increase in per capita consumption of 0.9 litres of pure alcohol by 2025. Total alcohol per capita consumption has increased globally after a relatively stable phase between 2000 and 2005. Since then, total per capita consumption rose from 5.5 litres in 2005 to 6.4 litres in 2010 and was still at the level of 6.4 litres in 2016, the report stated. However, diverging trends were noticed in different regions of the world. The harmful use of alcohol is one of the leading risk factors for population health worldwide and has a direct impact on many health-related targets of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), including those for maternal and child health, infectious diseases (HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis), noncommunicable diseases and mental health, injuries and poisonings. In 2016, the harmful use of alcohol resulted in some 3 million deaths (5.3 per cent of all deaths) worldwide and 132.6 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Mortality resulting from alcohol consumption is higher than that caused by diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and diabetes. Among men in 2016, an estimated 2.3 million deaths and 106.5 million DALYs were attributable to the consumption of alcohol. 0.7 million women died and they experienced 26.1 million DALYs attributable to alcohol consumption. The harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and injury conditions, the report stated. Some 2.3 billion people are current drinkers. Globally more than a quarter (26.5 per cent) of all 15–19 year-olds are current drinkers, amounting to 155 million adolescents. The WHO has emphasized on the development, implementation and evaluation of cost-effective interventions for harmful use of alcohol as well as creating, compiling and disseminating scientific information on alcohol use and dependence, and related health and social consequences. The ""Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol"", negotiated and agreed by WHO Member States in 2010, represents international consensus that reducing the harmful use of alcohol and its associated health and social burden is a public health priority. The strategy provides guidance for action at all levels, including 10 recommended target areas for policy options and interventions for national action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and the main components for global action to support and complement activities at country level."

""Setting targets under the National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme, which was launched in July this year, the Indian health ministry had pledged to achieve 100% usage of engineered safety devices to curtail injection related infections,"" said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, National Professional Officer, universal health coverage, WHO-India. He was in the city to speak at a workshop with Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences faculty and staff on safety-engineered syringes. Organised by SGPGI's gastroentrology department, which is also WHO Collaborating Centre for Viral Hepatitis, the workshop aimed at creating awareness on the issue of hepatitis. To note, RUP is a kind of safety engineered syringe which becomes redundant after one use. It is better than the prevalent disposable injections which can be re-used easily if not disposed correctly. Reuse of such syringes is associated with a number of diseases including hepatitis and HIV among others. ""Use of unsafe syringes is a major risk factor for hepatitis B and C. The switch from so-called disposable syringes will help in bringing down prevalence of hepatitis B and C by 30-35%,"" added Dr Lahariya. This is crucial considering that about 1.34 crore Indians suffer with hepatitis-C infection while an equal number carry hepatitis B. Unsafe use of injections is associated with a number of other diseases ranging from simple absys to HIV. In 2002-03, Indian government got a survey on usage of injections done. The only survey of its kind revealed that two-third of the syringes being used in India was unsafe. Experts believe that proportion of unsafe injections could have come down following adoption of auto-disable syringes in the national routine immunisation programme. But the extent of the problem still remains big as (according to 2002 study) average usage of syringes per person per year in India is 2.9. This translates into use of 350 - 400 crore injections in the country. ""The disease burden of problems like hepatitis and HIV stand self-explained considering that 50-65% of the injections are unsafe,"" said Dr Amit Goel, associated professor, gastroentrology, SGPGI. Senior faculty, gastroentrology, SGPGI, Prof Rakesh Aggarwal stated that in wake of these current scenario, investment in prevention of viral hepatitis by promotion of safety engineered syringes is public interest. ""Investment in prevention of a disease is always much lower than the amount that goes in treatment and rehabilitation,"" he said. NHM UP misses crucial policy event Besides causing viral hepatitis, use of unsafe syringes was associated with transmission of HIV. As per WHO, 33,877 persons contracted HIV because of unsafe injections across the world every year. In February last, indiscriminate use of a single injection in many persons by a quack in Unnao was associated with diagnosis of HIV positive in 45 persons in a village. But while Punjab has already adopted RUP syringes, UP is yet to start. On Thursday in fact, officials from UP's National Health Mission skipped the crucial policy orientation event. ""As for now, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh are the only Indian states to have begun the process of discarding the disposable syringes. But other states, particularly Uttar Pradesh join, India cannot achieve the target,"" he said."

The incident occurred on Monday morning when victim Shiva, along with his uncle Kuldeep Singh, was collecting fodder for his cows. The leopard then suddenly grabbed Shiva by his neck and dragged it along to the cane field. Later, Singh called for help after which two of his brothers reached the spot. After spotting the leopard, they attacked the animal with a stick and took Shiva to a hospital. However, the doctors declared Shiva brought dead. Doctors said he suffered grievous injuries on his neck and head. “Shiva and I were collecting fodder for our cows when suddenly a leopard jumped over and grabbed him by his neck and dragged him to sugarcane filed. I raised an alarm, and my two brothers—Ajay Kumar and Raj Kumar—immediately came to the rescue. We found the leopard at a sugarcane field and attacked it with stick. For 15 minutes we struggled to rescue Shiva. Later, we took Shiva to a district hospital, where the doctors declared him brought dead,” Singh said. Angry with the boy’s death, villagers, along with the victim’s family, protested against the Moradabad administration and forest officials. Swayed by the protest, the officials announced Rs 15 lakh as compensation. Sub-divisional magistrate Veenta Singh said the forest officials have been told to catch the leopard immediately. “The compensation amount will be delivered soon to the family members of the boy. We are in constant touch with the forest officials, and will do our best to avert such kind of incidents in future. The higher authorities have instructed the forest officials to lay down an effective strategy to cage the leopard as soon as possible.” Giving out reasons behind such attack, district forest official Kanhiya Patel said, “In search of food and water the leopards move to human populated areas from jungle. They can easily hide themselves inside the sugarcane crops. Presently, the leopard is hiding at the village and residents have been asked to be alert until it is caught. We have installed cages, and hopefully it will get trapped soon.”"

Known as ‘mann kaksh’, the centre will have two counsellors at any given time to attend to the patients. According to hospital authorities, the counsellors will hear the ‘mann ki baat’ of the mental health patients and ease them of their depression or any other apprehensions that they might be going through. The initiative is part of the National Mental Health programme. There are over 150 million individuals estimated to be suffering from mental health issues in the country. “Under the National Mental Health programme, a district counselling centre has been started in PL Sharma district hospital, where patients with mental illness or any kind of depression will be able to share their problems with the counsellors here. “Apart from the counsellors of mental health unit, counsellors appointed for other units like AIDS and Tuberculosis will also sit on duty here,” said Dr. PK Bansal, superintendent-in-chief, PL Sharma district hospital. There are a total of 12 counsellors in the district who are stationed at Community Health Centres (CHCs). These counsellors have been assigned duty such that at least two of them remain present at the centre at the district hospital, Bansal said.

Earlier, the unit was available only at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College in the city. However, this is the first time that a counselling centre has been opened. “People do not consider disorders like anxiety as a mental disease, which eventually leads to stress, hypertension and blood pressure.

They are persistent, and there is a common notion that they will cause embarrassment if you don't hand them money. At another friend’s sangeet ceremony, a band of transgenders swayed to peppy tunes amidst peel of laughter. These are the only experiences that I could recall. And so do many others. But is this all to their identity?Hijra Habba was organised in the capital on the 11th of September. The name may sound weird since its synonymous with the transgender community, and so it was. With over 400 transgenders in attendance, Hijra Habba brought diverse voices from across the country, of active members from the LGBT community, to discuss the need for change at the level of education, policy-making and community interaction to effectively normalise lives for the third gender. The event held greater significance in the light of the recent Supreme Court decision decriminalising Section 377. Born This WayIt’s not just Lady Gaga’s popular song, but also the theme of this year’s Hijra Habba. Their lifestyle is not an inconvenience but a truth that we have to accept in all its diverseness. ""Altering the behaviour and attitudes of the people and sensitisation of the masses is the reason why we have this platform"", says Sonal Mehta, Chief Executive, India HIV/AIDS Alliance. Alliance India is an NGO credited with organising this gathering. They work on capacity building, knowledge sharing, technical support and advocacy to people living with HIV. ""A lot of issues pertaining to basic rights and opportunities need to be talked about. They have a right to lead ordinary lives and not be fraught with glass ceilings in the simplest of ideas such as that of a whole family,"" says Nipun Srivastava, consultant for the NGO. While trans people may have been qualified as the third gender, do they, as legitimate citizens, have access to rights and opportunity that others enjoy? Remember Vicks tear jerking ad called Touch of Care? It touched upon the issues of adoption and transgender rights. It featured Gauri Sawant, a beautiful, magnanimous transgender woman and LGBT activist, who adopted a girl named Gayatri, whom she had saved from being sold. She was present at the Hijra Habba, and spoke to timesofindia.com. ""I was the first transgender petitioner to file a case in the Supreme Court regarding adoption rights to transgenders. I am not proud of if but ashamed that I had to go to the court to ask for what should be mine intrinsically."" Gauri has set up her own NGO, Sakhi Char Chowghi in Malad, Mumbai and dedicates her time to providing for other marginalised - transgenders, hijras, female sex workers among other. ""Motherhood is not a state, it is a behaviour. We love someone, which automatically makes us a mother. This need to nurture is natural, and we deserve it as much as a heterosexual woman or man."" Gauri has also started Aaji cha Ghar, a safe and friendly home for the abandoned girl children of sex workers and destitute senior transgenders. It is a project under Sai Sawli Trust and also her dream project. But sadly, Gauri has little support from the government. All help comes from milaap fundraisers. But she is a firm believer in Swami Vivekananda's saying that you must not ask the society what it can do for you, but prove that you can do so much for the society. You and I may celebrate the victory of the community that has been suppressed and made to feel oppressed about their existence, and often completely denied any rights whatsoever. Indians may thump its chest loudly for doing away with the arbitrary and unfair treatment meted out to the LGBTQ community, in theory at least. But the battle is half won, however for the society, because it isn’t just section 377 they fought tooth and nail. With the law finally in their favour, will the marginalised community feel at ease? No. This was the response of over three dozen people who were asked this question. And one of the factors is a common understanding, rooted in some studies, that HIV/AIDS is spread more widely in the LGBTQ community. It is a catcall for discrimination - being HIV positive, or being a transgender. There are some who are both. The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) India estimates that HIV's prevalence amongst transgenders is at 7.5%. In addition to the deviance inscribed on the bodies of those who are markedly different from the ‘regular’ folk, the stigma attached to people living with HIV has made matters worse. ""It is a widely believed that HIV spreads more prominently among homosexuals. We have never been to the root of the issue which is lack of healthcare facilities for the LGBTQ community especially transgenders, who are turned away from hospitals at times due to institutional or individual prejudices. The absence of structural support in terms of education employment and health has made transgenders far more likely to take to substance abuse,"" opines Ritika, who works with Vihaan, a programme that works to reduce stigma and discrimination against HIV affected people. And her words are true. A study by the National Institute of Epidemiology among 60,000 transgender people across 17 states revealed that the biggest perpetrators of violence against transgender people were police and law-enforcing authorities. In a country where the system is against them, this community has little hope. But some people have been fighting this stigma from within the society. Simran Shaikh, a senior program officer at Wajood is one such individual. She enlists why events like Hijra Habba are a necessity. ""Wajood focuses on access to sexual health and mitigating violence among the transgender community. HIV is not transgender community specific; it impacts people all over. But transgenders have been on the receiving end of a lot of sexual abuse, which also exacerbates the current status. Additionally, due to social ostracization, many trans individuals are pushed into becoming sex workers. It also happens due to the unavailability of other job opportunities. Such social realities need to be kept into account when dealing with an HIV positive transgender. They need to be counselled since most of them face familial boycott at a very young age, among other gross injustices such as tantric practices performed on them."" Hijra Habba highlighted the sense of community between people of the LGBTQ spectrum and also brought into light their isolation from the wider society. There were dance and musical performances, a fashion show, and even a theatre performance by Asmita group. It is however a sobering feeling - the community has to put on a show to make its voice heard. Many in the crowd quietly mocked the display of exuberance of the organisers and the participants alike. But it does not deter Simran Shaikh, who adopted a girl, in spite of all deterrence from the society. ""Today they are laughing at us, but they must be absorbing something from this experience. Tomorrow, when they see a transgender begging on the road, they’ll hopefully realise that we are not born to just beg or be sex workers. After today, they will know that we can do a lot more, like any other person around them. We just need a chance. It is our right."""

She sustained serious head injuries. We found her aadhaar card from the purse and informed her son about the tragic incident. He rushed to the spot and took her to a nearby hospital but she died on the way,” added a local resident. Police have registered a case of causing death due to rash driving and driving in the dedicated BRT corridor against the unknown car driver. “We have gathered CCTV footage of the accident and will identify the accused soon,” added a senior police official."

Failure to detect and treat HIV early may not just cause irreversible neurological damages, but also prove fatal for babies. Doctors at the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital recently discovered the worrying trend while analyzing data of 1,410 babies who were tested for HIV between 2015 and 2018 at the reference laboratory in Kasturba Hospital. At six weeks of birth, infants born to HIV-infected mothers are subjected to the first test, which if positive, is repeated immediately. This second test assumes great significance as the child is immediately started on antiretroviral therapy (ART), if this report too comes positive. The study showed that merely 61% of parents returned for the second confirmatory test. “We were surprised to see that so many parents are missing out on the second visit, thereby delaying the child’s treatment,” said Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who heads the molecular lab at Kasturba that receives samples from 36 HIV testing and counselling centres across the city. The laboratory also gets dried blood spot samples from Gujarat, Goa and Madhya Pradesh. “Such a delay is unfortunate as the advances in ART assure that children with HIV escape the serious neurological damages,” she said. Nair hospital’s Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre has found migration to be one of the biggest reasons. “In 70% of these cases, parents are migrants, who come here for child delivery and return to their hometowns. In a small percentage, it’s also the lack of understanding about the seriousness of HIV,” said Medha Deorukhkar, a counsellor at the centre. Around 46% of children were lost to follow-up, the analysis found. The national protocol warrants that babies be followed up to 18 months as antibodies from mother could give out false positivity in tests carried out before that. In fact, regular follow-ups and counselling are crucial not just for HIV-positive babies, but also for negative ones. While India data is scarce, it has been found that babies who have escaped contracting the virus during birth may still get it through breastfeeding. “Counselling is crucial as mothers may not comprehend the harm of switching between breast milk to formula milk,” said a doctor from Sion hospital’s paediatric centre of excellence for HIV. “Bottle feeds cause ulceration on the gut wall, which makes it conducive for the virus to enter the baby’s bloodstream.” Dr Shikala Acharya, assistant project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, said while mother-to-child transmission has dropped to less than 0.2%, tracking remains a challenge. In 2017-18, of around 460 deliveries in HIV-positive women, four babies tested positive. She said in families where the couple has not informed extended family, pursuing them to return for testing of the child becomes difficult. But Dr Anju Seth, director of paediatrics at Delhi’s Lady Hardinge Medical College, said it’s worth the effort as virus suppression is crucial here. “The first three years of a child’s life is when maximum growth happens. If the virus is not controlled, damages like stunting of height, weight and developmental milestones could be permanent.”"

Rajasthan police have also hired an agency for creating these messages, which are then released under the supervision of ADG (Crime). Despite the fact that their message on Jasprit Bumrah, the pacer of Indian cricket team conceding a no ball in a match against Pakistan, went awry, the police is using everything from festivals to movies to spread their message. The most recent one was posted by Rajasthan police on Friday on twitter asking people to wear helmets, saying, “#Bollywood inspires us all. Don’t bring that inspiration on roads and try to be Khataron Ke Khiladi. We will come knocking like Singham and say Aata Majhi Satakali,” (the famous one-liner of the protagonist played by Ajay Devgun in the movie Singham). “See, the idea is to reach out to the youngsters who get carried away by various things. I think social networking has become a powerful tool to give out a loud and clear message on how people should behave while driving, why youngsters should keep themselves away from drugs and other things,” said Pankaj Singh, additional director general (Crime), talking to TOI on Friday. Moreover, police are also sharing messages asking people to be strong enough to avoid becoming victims of cybercrime. “We have said that people sometimes make mistakes like sharing passwords, clicking on unsecured links and revealing personal information. We are communicating with people, as in this day and age, a 4G network and smartphones are accessible to all,” he added. While the momo challenge was making news for leading people to commit suicide, the police posted, “Momos are always welcome on dinner table, but not on your phone.” On the ill-effects of drugs, the police had posted, “Did you know — 11 million people worldwide inject drugs, of which 1.3 million have HIV, 5.5 million have Hepatitis C and 1 million have both the diseases’’. In some of the messages, police are also using an accompanying video to make the message more impactful, like they did on Janmashtami, “We have said that like Krishna always stood resolute to protect his friends from demons in disguise, we are also vigilant and determined to protect our kid friends from demons. We make sure our kids are safe and protected,” he added. The police first gets the rough draft of these messages before they are posted, and finally after the approval and changes, these messages are published on social networking platforms like twitter. Rajasthan police has 13,000 followers on twitter and the number is increasing. Cops get creative: “You don’t need a shot of Heroin to be a hero. Be a real HERO by saying a BIG NO to drugs. Get high on life, not on drugs” “Yeh Rakshabandhan hai Surakshabandhan” (Asking women to speak up to their police ‘brothers’) “Don’t huff, don’t puff, stay away from the stuff. Be with us to make a healthier society” “Yo #Kikichallenge kain chai, Gaadi se nikal kar naachbo, traffic niyamo ne todbo kikichallenge ne karba ko tareeko chai, hain? pher to ya #kikichallenge galat chai.” (A message in Marwari asking people to stay away from the kiki challenge)"

About five years ago, I came out to my sister as my parents are no more. She took me to a psychiatrist who subjected me to electroshock therapy. I had to undergo three sessions — the first one lasted 20 minutes and I was in severe pain. I told my sister I don’t want to undergo “treatment” but they took me again after a week, sedated me and gave me a shock again, for a longer period. I had a final session after another week, and the doctor declared that I was “normal”. I am still gay. My sister is married and thinks that I am bisexual, and that it is a phase of life that will pass, and that someday I will marry a girl. I’ve had a boyfriend for a year and a half. Since he is still studying, he hasn’t yet come out, but we do plan to get married and hopefully now, it will happen sooner. Now that the law has changed, other changes will follow. In India, when a law changes, the mindset of people gradually changes. The community now needs more understanding than acceptance. Personally, I can go to my sister and say that I am gay, I have a boyfriend and I am not a criminal. I have equal rights like any other Indian citizen. - As told to Priya M MenonWENDELL RODRICKS, 58, FASHION DESIGNER, GOAWhen people say ‘life in the shadows’, it is not an accurate description of what a person from the LGBTQ community experiences. What we experience is a life of sheer terror and fear. At every turn, one is faced with revealing the truth and wanting to live honestly with oneself. I am fortunate to have had family and friends who were supportive. But I know I am in a minuscule minority to enjoy the privilege of being open and yet loved and respected. The judgment on 377 will change lives. It was always my mission to battle 377 not for myself but for the youth and future generations. This judgment is historic not only for India but India’s progressive stance in the world. The people of the world will look at India in a new light. Something we should all celebrate for our country. It touched my heart when the judges stated that the country apologise for the pain suffered by LGBTQ and our families. I did not expect an apology. Nor did one expect the judges to put out the words like “I am what I am”. To quote a song that is an anthem for the LGBTQ community is heartening. Today the community can sing that anthem with pride, dignity and in the inclusivity of equal human rights for all Indians. ANAND CHANDRANI, 42, GAY RIGHTS ACTIVIST, NAGPURYes, finally. What I feel right now cannot be classified as happy or sad. I’m mostly relieved. A huge burden has been lifted from our shoulders. I am out as a gay person and I’m not worried for myself but I know of everyday stories of suicide, of youngsters running away from home, being beaten and blackmailed. Boys were forced to marry girls. Now we’ll be rid of these pressures gradually. People used to be scared of going to the police, but now they’ll be able to muster the courage to file a complaint if they face harassment. Earlier, whenever people used to wish me on Independence Day, I would reply ‘I’m still a criminal in my own country’. After living through many Independence Days, I’ll now scream that I too am free. I founded an NGO, Sarathi, 12 years ago, and believed that someday this will come true. Discussions about sexuality have now begun in houses and I’ve got calls from siblings of gay individuals asking how they can support their brother or sister. The fight has just begun. Social acceptance will come with time. If one has the right to marry, people will be bound in legal relationships and this will in turn reduce the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. - As told to Abha Goradia‘Called my dad and told him, BBC says I’m gay so it must be true’ PARMESH SHAHANI, 42, HEAD OF GODREJ INDIA CULTURE LAB, MUMBAII met my partner at a queer film festival in Mumbai in 2016. We sat next to each other and our arms touched. It was electrifying. I wondered if I was looking at an apparition or a human being, he was so gorgeous. We talked through the film. I was wearing a shawl and I asked if he was feeling cold. He wasn’t but of course he said that he was. So, we shared the shawl. We’re from different universes but love has brought us together. It’s challenging because he is 20 years younger than me and closeted — even his family doesn’t know — whereas I’m “super” out. I came out to my family in 2004 and was one of the lucky ones because my family accepted it without batting an eyelid. I came out very dramatically. My mom knew but I hadn’t told my dad. I was organising an LGBTQ film festival and the BBC wrote about it and put it on the front page of their website. So, I called my dad and said, “The BBC says I’m gay so it must be true because it’s the BBC.” I’m hopeful that Section 377 going away will liberate the LGBTQ community to love more freely and confidently. My partner and I would love to get married — even though in our minds we already are — and have it be recognised in India. Decriminalisation and equality are very different. There’s a long journey ahead before our love is considered equal. - As told to Nergish SunavalaANKIT SHARMA, 30, GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE, AJMERIt was September 17, 2014, my 24th birthday. I had decided to finally tell my family about my sexual orientation. I had been dreading the moment as mine is a traditional family where men only marry women. But I had to tell them the truth about who I am. “What gift do you want, Ankit,” my mother asked as soon as I woke up. This is the moment, I thought to myself. I switched on my phone and showed them an episode from Aamir Khan’s TV show where he interviews a gay person. The idea was to make them understand that not all males like females and vice versa. They watched the videos, my family seemed OK, so I told them I am one such person. There was a few minutes’ silence. Then they said I should never talk about it again. That was the last I heard from them on the topic. Initially, they thought I was trying to avoid marriage. Then they realised I wasn’t lying and began efforts to “heal” me. They took me to pujaris and tantriks and psychiatrists. One psychiatrist tried to counsel them that I was medically fit, but they wouldn’t listen. I was always skinny as a child and classmates would tease me about being effeminate. When I was older, I realised I am gay. I knew I was not wrong and that it was society that was unaware. It has been difficult, living without talking about it. I work for the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation as a store sub-inspector. This is a historic day and a freeing judgment. I now have a new life to look forward to. I am in love. He is from Maharashtra. Maybe we can get married now. - As told to Syed Intishab AliNAVIN NORONHA, STAND-UP COMEDIAN, MUMBAIIt’s always difficult to come out in a homophobic nation, especially since you are brought up with the same notion of hating and attacking someone who isn’t like you. It’s been a real uphill climb and I’ve lost several friends and family members. The ones who stuck with me mean the world to me. My mom is as woke as the millennials. I’ve been out to my friends since I was 19. At 22, I came out publicly at a comedy open mic and I haven’t looked back. I am one of India’s few professional comedians who talks openly about being gay in India. While I was aware that the law does not stop me from existing as a gay man, my partner and I have to constantly double check if every window and every door is tightly shut before we can hug properly or kiss each other. The law was twisted and used by homophobes to just shun the queer community. The scrapping of Section 377 will give others the confidence to embrace their identity. This life of dual identities can turn toxic and has led people down the road of addiction, self-harm and anxiety. No human should be scared to make love as they want to. Today we have several more LGBTQ members in the mainstream. We have strived hard not to be dismissed as a minority. As the American rock band Starship proclaimed in their song, all I’d like to say is ‘Nothing’s gonna stop us now’. - As told to Mohua DasNAMITHAA JAYASANKAR, 24, STUDENT, CHENNAII identify as a queer woman. ‘Queer’ is an umbrella term, which encompasses all identities within the spectrum. When I was about 14 years old, I realised that I appreciate the female form though I didn’t know what I identified as. Then J K Rowling (author of the Harry Potter series) said she always considered the character of Dumbledore gay. That had such a huge impact on me and I decided to explore my identity. I have been an activist for six years but have never come out to my parents. It is implied in the house. My mother keeps all the press cuttings in which I am referred to as a queer woman. But as the term ‘queer’ is ambiguous, my parents don’t think too much about it. I have spoken to them about the stigma and discrimination faced by the LGBT community and the violation of human rights. I consider myself privileged as I come from an urban, educated, upper middle class family. I have not had to face stigma and discrimination, but my relationships have always been hidden. The SC judgment has not yet sunk in, though I know it will change the lives of many. Hopefully it will help me talk to my parents. I hope to be able to talk openly to my younger cousins, nephews and nieces. I hope the SC judgment will help more queer women come out. Then, there are larger issues of being independent, financially and emotionally. - As told to Priya M MenonIn Video:Historic verdict: SC rules gay sex is not a crime; what is Section 377?"

The bench termed sexual orientation as a ""biological phenomenon"" and ""natural"" and held that any discrimination on this ground was violative of the fundamental rights. The top court decriminalised part of the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code that criminalises consensual gay sex, saying it was irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary. UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), also welcomed the historic decision, saying criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual relations is a violation of human rights and legitimizes prejudice and violence against LGBTI people. ""Today is a day of gay pride, a day of celebration, a day when respect and dignity was finally restored in India for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people,"" said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS. ""I applaud the brave activists, civil society organisations and community groups that have fought long and hard for this injustice to be reversed."" UNAIDS said that criminalization hinders people from accessing and using HIV prevention, testing and treatment services and increases their risk of acquiring HIV. In India, HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who have sex with men is 2.7% and among transgender people is 3.1%, compared to the national HIV prevalence among all adults of just 0.26%. Around three out of ten gay men and four out of ten transgender people in India who are living with HIV do not know their HIV status. Many LGBTI people living with HIV do not have access to HIV treatment, the UN agency said. It added that gay men account for 18 per cent of all new HIV infections worldwide. UNAIDS urged countries to ensure the full respect of the human rights of all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, through repealing laws that prohibit sex between consenting adults in private, enforcing laws to protect people from violence and discrimination, addressing homophobia and transphobia and ensuring that crucial health services are made available. ""I hope this decision sets the trend and is followed by similar decisions in other countries that remove unjust laws criminalizing homosexuality,"" Sidibe said. In June 2016, United Nations Member States committed in the Political Declaration on Ending AIDS to promote laws and policies that ensure the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for children, adolescents and young people, particularly those living with, at risk of and affected by HIV, so as to eliminate the stigma and discrimination that they face."
"176","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/with-no-disclosure-norms-most-hiv-kids-learn-about-ailment-after-parents-death/articleshow/65663382.cms",2018-09-04,"Throughout her childhood, 14-year-old Mona would overhear terms such as ‘HIV’ and ‘AIDS’ uttered in hushed tones at her Solapur house. The mystery ended two years ago when her mother succumbed to AIDS following a ten-year battle. Her bedridden father, also afflicted by the virus, broke the news to her just a day later. “It’s a germ in our blood that will stay with us forever. It has not spared you either,” says Mona, recalling her father’s words. The revelation, she vividly remembers, was followed by a directive to keep it a secret. More than the disease, it was the secrecy that instilled a deep sense of shame. Similarly, Pandharpur native Sundari (13) barely had time to cope with her father’s death when she was told about her HIV status. That was the first time her grandfather told her that it was AIDS that killed her parents. Unable to bear the ill-treatment meted out to her by the extended family, the grandfather put her in an orphanage, where she presently lives. Studies have underlined the criticality of disclosure—telling someone about their HIV status—in fighting the disease and how, when done under tragic circumstances and without counselling, it can damage the way an HIV-infected child or an adolescent view themselves for the rest of their lives. The lack of a holistic framework in India has left parents, caregivers and institutions grappling to find the right approach. Several children discover the ailment accidentally or at the time of losing a parent; many come to know when they are being discriminated against, or worse, after they have been sexually abused. The complex questions of ‘how to tell’ and ‘when to tell’ is simply passed over at Pune-based Manavya, one of the oldest homes in Maharashtra to care for HIV positive children. The caretakers never let out the “secret” even as they teach every child how to take medicines and fight the disease. “If they have questions about HIV, we answer them scientifically,” said Shirish Lawate, trustee of Manavya. Children as young as five start questioning their daily medications. “We tell them it’s to kill the jantu (organism) inside their body,” says Sushma Apte, one of the coordinators. Visits to hospitals and ART centres seem to be one of the common ways children discover their HIV status. Fifteen-year-old Sushila says, “I figured I had HIV by looking at posters at Solapur Civil Hospital. But it took me a while to understand there are ways other than physical relationships to get HIV,” she says. The teenager is from Palawi in Pandharpur, a residential institution run by Mangaltai Shah and her daughter Dimple Ghadge that provides shelter to 110 HIV children. Ghadge says counselling at state-run ART centres is perfunctory. “That’s perhaps the reason why mental health issues, particularly depression, mood swings and anger is rampant among them,” says Ghadge. Chinmayi Modi, a member of the National Coalition of People living with HIV India (NCPI+), adds that the incidence of suicides among HIV-affected youth is high but there is no verifiable data. At the Bandra-based CCDT, for in-house residents older than 10-12 years, the disclosure is done gradually keeping the child’s maturity in mind. It’s when families are involved, says programme director Poonam DSouza, that it becomes challenging. “All parents want to delay it till their children are in late teens,” she says. “But we discourage late disclosures since children at that age start having relationships and should be aware of the risks of unsafe sex,” she adds. Brahmadev from Vihaan, an NGO working for HIV, says it’s common for children to blame parents, run away from home and stop taking medicines. Unlike practices worldwide, where a lot of thought goes into disclosing a child’s HIV status, no structure exists here, says Shabana Patel, president of Network of Maharashtra People with HIV (NMP+). ""The first counselling when a child starts ART is crucial and should last for a minimum of 45 minutes. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen even for 5 minutes,"" says Patel. In Maharashtra, there is one counsellor for every 300 HIV patients. Parimal Singh, who heads Maharashtra State Aids Control Society, said a methodology is being drawn up to ensure those who have adherence issues don't miss out on quality counselling. Mumbai’s Sion Hospital has developed some tools for this purpose. Counsellor Laxman Jamkhandi uses storytelling to educate his young patients. White cells vital to the immune system assume the role of good soldiers that need the aid of weapons like ART drugs and nutrition to kill the black demon virus. “A superhero story never fails to get the attention of children,"" he says. ""With better ART, children are surviving for decades, so it's better their body and mind starts accepting it early.”"

The HIV-positive girl is hearing impaired and her mental ability is that of a child half her age. Like her, at least 60% of the 110 inmates at Solapur’s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, the state’s oldest institution caring for children with HIV, suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. TOI found that the prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over 30% have stymied mental development. AIDS-related deaths may have dropped by 54% in India over a decade, but most children in rural areas living on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are barely surviving, afflicted by physical and mental deficiencies. The reason: the national programme focuses on medicines instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model. For the nearly three lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors, mostly underpaid, and overburdened with administrative work. A fourth of India’s 60,000-odd children taking ART for HIV live in Maharashtra. With no adequate support, the state recently learned that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have quietly dropped out. Stunted, depressed, low on hearing: HIV+ kids face fallout despite drugsSumana looks like a 10-year-old though she’s a teenager 11 months shy of 18. Four feet tall and with body weight of 30kg, she is at least 25kg underweight and significantly short for her age. Her mental ability is of a child half her age and she is hearing impaired. At Solapur’s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, one of Maharashtra’s oldest institutions caring for children living with HIV, cases like Sumana’s are not an exception. At least 60% of the 110 children here suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. The prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over a third have stymied mental development. Besides physical, prevalence of mental health problems such as depression is alarmingly high. AIDS-related deaths have dropped by 54% and new infections by 66% in India over a decade, but children like Sumana are a testimony to the gaping deficit in the national programme that focuses on drugs instead of a holistic medical, nutritional and psychosocial model that a complex disease such as HIV warrants. A little over a quarter of the 60,000 such children are in Maharashtra. An otherwise spirited child, Sumant gets drowsy and irritable after taking medicines. “I get severe stomach-ache, dizziness, headache and diarrhoea,'' he says, describing his plight after taking the daily dose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines. Born with the virus, these children need to take two to six capsules daily. For additional infections such as tuberculosis, the pill count could run into double digits. Their very survival depends on following this regimen, but the six-year-old Sumant is among 17 children at the Palawi home who refuse to continue with ART . “Children go through hell in spite of ART. There is no denying the dramatic shift in HIV care today, but what about those who got the disease at the turn of the century and have spent a lifetime taking medicines. We know little or nothing about what the virus or ART does to each child?” said Palawi's founder, 65-year-old Mangaltai Shah. She says most children in Palawi grapple with problems ranging from skin rashes, oral and vaginal yeast infections, pus accumulation in ears, hearing and vision problems to life-threatening infections such as TB. “So when medicines meant to heal start giving additional trouble, they find it easier to discard.” Moreover, she adds, at Rs 25 per child per day institutions like Palawi neither have adequate funds nor support from government hospitals to tackle the unique health problems of each child. Sumant is supposed to receive intensive counselling from the local ART centre till his adherence improves, but Shah says the three doctors and four counsellors that cater to 300 HIV patients daily at Solapur Civil Hospital barely have the time to look up. For nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors. Another Palawi resident, four-year-old Khusboo, suffered hearing loss after recurrent ear infections. The diagnosis didn't come from the ART centre, but from her teacher at Palawi’s in-house Gyan Mandir school, who noticed Khusboo was oblivious to classroom activities. The institution was compelled to start its own school in 2014—a ground-plus-one structure next to the orphanage on Pandharpur’s outskirts—as children are denied admission in regular schools the moment Palawi is mentioned. But it’s a blessing in disguise for these children who struggle to sit through more than one or two classes without dozing off. “A regular school wouldn’t understand or probably tolerate it,” Patil says. Palawi which has been home to 250 HIV-positive children since 2001, has lost 40 to the disease. AIDS claims an average of 2,500 lives in Maharashtra annually; how many are children is not known. The state recently discovered that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have dropped out. Here too, paediatric percentage is unclear. On paper, 16,000 children in Maharashtra are on treatment. Coping is equally challenging for children in the community, who having lost one or both parents to the virus, face vulnerabilities starting from poor access to healthcare and government entitlements to education and nutrition. Now 17, Palghar native Sachin has been on ART since he was three. He lost his mother at birth and father last December to HIV. He admits to skipping his daily 10-pill regimen. He dropped out of school due to his condition. “The pain would begin after the morning pills. I would cry in class and be compelled to lie down,” said Sachin who can't keep a job either as the medicines make him “drowsy and tired”. At four-feet and grossly underweight at 35kg, Sachin typifies the wasting and stunting associated with HIV. HIV is a neurotropic virus that not just attacks the immune system but practically affects every organ, resulting in damage to nerve tissues, cognitive development, physical growth, and at the same time causing learning difficulties, speech and language problems. Experts say it’s crucial to monitor toxicity and provide 360-degree healthcare. Dr Ira Shah, an expert in paediatric HIV, says it’s not enough to tell children to take medicines lifelong. “These are toxic drugs given at a much younger age. It is necessary to monitor bone health or metabolic acidosis before the children become intolerant,” she said. In one of her published papers, she wrote about three children who died of neurological complications caused by HIV despite their viral load being suppressed with drugs. National Aids Control Organisation deputy director Dr R S Gupta admits little is known about how children cope with ART. But he underlines the fact that “they live longer because of the medicines and the average life expectancy now exceeds 20.” There are side-effects, but “what is important is they are alive”. Ironically, Sumant, Khusboo, Sachin are Indian HIV programme's success stories even though they are not thriving but merely surviving. (Names of all patients have been changed)"

The village, which is located on either side of the NH-8, has seen the highest number of fatal accidents in the district over the past several years, mostly involving people crossing the highway. On Sunday evening, one more pedestrian died after being hit by a speeding car while crossing the median at Narsinghpur. According to the FIR filed at the Sector 37 police station, he was trying to climb the median grille in a bid to cross to the other flank of the road when the car hit him. The pedestrian was thrown into the air before landing a few metres away and died on the spot, police said. Though official figures put the number of accidents along the highway in Narsinghpur to six in 2016 and eight the year before, the villagers say not less than 40-50 people fall prey to hit-and-run accidents every year. Narsinghpur houses predominantly members of the Gujjar community and a significant population of migrant labourers from Bengal and Bihar. Sanjiv Bedi, a resident of Narsinghpur, said, “Authorities have failed to stop two-wheelers from taking the foot-over bridge (FoB). Owing to this, pedestrians find it tough to use the footbridge. Immediate measures should be taken so that the FoB is reserved only for pedestrians and not motorists.” The NHAI, when contacted, has said maintenance of the expressway is the responsibility of Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), the concessionaire. Moreover, pedestrians are not allowed to cross the expressway, and will have to take the FoB) to cross the road. Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI (Gurgaon), said, “One can cross the expressway only by using FoBs or pedestarian underpasses. Median grilles have been installed to prevent pedestrians from crossing the road. This is an enforcement problem. This has to be prevented by MCEPL with or without the help of the police. People need to follow the rules to avert these accidents.” MCEPL is responsible for upkeep of roads, street lights, drains and CCTV cameras from Delhi Cantonment area till Kherki-Daula, according to the concessionaire. “We’re doing our work properly,” said MCEPL CEO S Raghuraman. Col Subhash Yadav, general manager, Skylark Securitas Pvt Ltd, the toll operator that has been given the responsibility of the entire stretch, said, “We have ensured that all medians are closed. It is the responsibility of pedestrians not to use the highway. On a highway, vehicles go at a high speed. NHAI has built a FoB why don’t the people use it?” Last month, the entire stretch has seen only one accident, which was also not fatal. People cross the highway by breaching the rules to reach hospitals, schools, ATMs and post office, and t avail other utilities. “Yes, the entire stretch has four points where pedestrians breach the median. Time and again, we have put barbed wires and repaired them too. However, pedestrians cut these wires to cross over to Narsinghpur,” Yadav said. Experts suggested that new alternative methods should be enforced to prevent pedestrian deaths. Professor Sewa Ram of the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) said the authorities concerned should set up level-crossings if people were not willing to use the FoB. “Level-crossings should be set up at busy intersections. These are road crossings, and most of them have traffic signals and either barriers or gates, which shut the road when cars are approaching. This system can have alarms also to warn pedestrians on approaching vehicles,” said Sewa Ram."

The good news is that the deadly viral disease continues to be on a decline among general population. The worrying part: In certain pockets of the state, the disease is raging among high-risk populations like female sex workers. According to the HSS, Maharashtra is 16th in terms of HIV prevalence, a positive shift of four places since the last survey in 2014-15. From 0.29%, the prevalence has reduced to 0.26%. An official from the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) said it was a significant drop as the HIV prevalence is now lower than the national average of 0.28%. But experts say it’s still not time to rejoice as certain sites catering to high-risk populations such as men having sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users and female sex workers have shown a significant prevalence. Though Maharashtra is one of the states to record less than 5% HIV positivity in female sex workers, there are four sites where the prevalence has been found to be 5%. At one site, it was around 10%. Among the female sex workers in the state, the prevalence (3.48%) is more than double the national average (1.56%). Nagpur-based NGO Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) that has been working with female sex workers said migration has emerged as a major challenge over the years. “Commercial sex workers have started migrating and moving out of traditional pockets making it difficult to track, test or treat them. It poses a direct threat to the general population,” said Hemlata Lohave from IRCS. She added that dwindling financial resources, too, have made their job difficult. “Often we are working without funds for months. Even now, for instance, we haven’t received money for the last quarter. We regularly lose trained workers as we can’t pay salaries,” she said. Among MSMs, the state is fifth on the national chart with the prevalence hovering around 4.69%, which is higher than the national average of 2.69%. However, in HSS 2014-15, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 7.4% and 4.9% among MSMs. Mumbai, too, is one of the sites with high HIV prevalence among truckers. There were nine sites with more than 1% HIV prevalence among long-distance truckers, including Mumbai with 1.2% prevalence. The MDACS official said the state is working on newer strategies. “We are aware that infections are still high in metropolitan cities. In high-risk pockets, we are testing at the community level. We are also looking at multi-month dispensation of antiretroviral drugs so that a patient can come to us once in three months rather than every month,” he said."

The HIV-positive girl is hearing impaired and her mental ability is of a child half her age. Like her, at least 60% of the 110 inmates at Solapur's Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, the state's oldest institution caring for children with HIV, suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. TOI found that the prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over 30% have stymied mental development. AIDS-related deaths may have dropped by 54% in India over a decade, but most children in rural areas living on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are barely surviving, afflicted by physical and mental deficiencies. The reason: the national programme focuses on medicines instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model. For the nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors, mostly underpaid, and overburdened with administrative work. A fourth of India's 60,000-odd children taking ART for HIV live in Maharashtra. With no adequate support, the state recently learned that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have quietly dropped out."

Besides his mother, Chinmay and his father too tested positive for HIV, considered a death sentence in 2002. A single doctor consultation cost the family Rs 50,000 in Surat and the medicines another few extra thousands. Still at the end of every visit, Modi and his parents would return home dejected and feeling closer to death. Soon they decided to give up the expensive treatment and prepared to meet their end. They went on without medicines for close to a year till India rolled out the national programme under which patients were given free antiretroviral medicines. “We were among the first 200 people in a Surat hospital to get that,” says Modi, crediting the government initiative that is presently keeping over a million alive. Taking 15 pills was not easy for a nine-year-old. Modi, now 25, says he has been successfully taking ART for 16 years and could only do it because he had the support of a family. “The need of an emotional and social support in HIV treatment is not appreciated enough. No child wants to eat medicines daily when it causes diarrhoea and stomach pain. I could sustain the treatment as I come from a well-off family where I got adequate nutrition and push to have medicines everyday. Still opportunistic infections like herpes afflicted me,” says the member of National Coalition of People living with HIV India (NCPI+). Modi says that while India did well in providing medicines, its efforts halted just there. “Even today, it is challenging for a child to eat medicines daily, hiding from friends and under the looming fear of getting caught,” he says. He, therefore, emphasizes on the role of a family, kin or a counsellor. “The child needs to know why he is eating medicines. In the absence of this awareness, they have low adherence levels, which in turn gives rise to resistance,"" he says. The government must find out why so many children are fast shifting from first to second line of drugs. “There is no quality counselling. Not more than ten minutes is spared explaining them,” says Modi adding that now when children are living till adolescence and adulthood, the quality of their lives must be a part of the HIV narrative in the country."

The Insurance and Regulatory Authority of India (IRDAI) in a notification Monday said in a partial modification of guidelines on standardisation of health insurance business some items have been deleted from the list of “items for which optional cover may be offered by insurers”. These include dental treatment that does not require hospitalisation but is widely availed of, hormone replacement therapy, infertility, subfertility, assisted conception procedures, obesity treatment, psychiatric and psychosomatic procedures, corrective surgery for refractive error, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, any expense for retro virus or suffering from HIV and AIDS, stem cell implantation, etc. ‘Covering more procedures in insurance will fix anomaly’Industry executives say the move to include more medical procedures in insurance is aimed at correcting an anomaly. “Earlier these items were optional and, therefore, were not covered by most insurers. Now, insurers can design products to include these items,” an industry analyst and researcher said. The insurance regulator may soon provide more clarity by issuing a separate order making it binding on companies to include these procedures in their plans, according to a source. Insurance penetration in India remains low. Merely 43 crore individuals, or 34% of the population, was covered under any health insurance in the year 2016-17, according to the National Health Profile 2018, compiled by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence. Despite the spread of private coverage, growth in health insurance is mainly driven by government-funded schemes or social insurance. Private sector coverage is largely limited to urban households. Even among those who have some coverage, 79% are under public insurance companies. While these companies have a higher share of coverage and premium for all types of health insurance policies, except family floater policies, including individual policies, private-sector schemes lead to high out-ofpocket expenditure. According to NHP 2018 data, the claims ratio by private insurers was 67%, whereas by public insurance companies 120% during 2016-17. In 2017, 70% of the total expenditure on health in India was paid out of pocket, according to WHO’s health financing profile."

Medical expert KK Aggarwal said, ""Viral hepatitis and HIV coinfection is a common problem and challenge to the treating clinician. People with HIV who are coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at increased risk for serious, life-threatening health complications. All people living with HIV should be tested for Hepatitis B and C infections as well."" HIV, HBV, and HCV have similar routes of transmission. They spread by contact with infected body fluids such as blood, semen and vaginal fluid, or from a mother to her baby during pregnancy or delivery. Due to these shared routes of transmission, people at risk for HIV infection are also at risk for HBV or HCV infection. Of these, HIB is more infectious.""

Environmental activists say that many healthcare centres that produce large quantities of bio-medical waste either dump it in open spaces or burn it at open dumpsites. Realising that these methods pose serious risks and can cause both health and environmental hazards, the Pollution Control Board (PCB) has indigenously developed eco-friendly ways to safely segregate and dispose all the hazardous waste. Segregation of waste in colour-coded paddle-operated covered bins is one of the most effective ways that PCB has introduced, and it also provides training to paramedical staff and waste handlers to segregate and discard all infectious, non-infectious, bio-degradable and re-cyclable material. N Raveendher, former environmental scientist with the Pollution Control Board said, “In most of the health care centres, the fault lies with hospital authorities and waste handlers. They simply do not follow the rules even after repeated warnings.” Dr P Surya, who runs a private clinic at Nagole says, “The main things that have to be disposed in clinics are syringes, as no amount of boiling can kill some viruses like HIV. A simple incinerator machine costing a few hundred rupees does the trick, but a majority of them just don’t use it.” The tip of the syringe is put into a slot in the incinerator which burns it off and then the glass body of the syringe is sterilised, then smashed and disposed of as regular municipal waste as it becomes harmless. However, a lot of the smaller private clinics as well as nursing homes are known to throw their needles along with regular waste. According to experts, the situation is mostly due to lack of awareness. A few healthcare centres have started segregating and incinerating their waste but there is still a long way to go."

Since little over a month, 16 children aged between six months and two years are being given pellets, which look like homeopathy pills, containing drugs lopinavir and ritonavir. The pellets, that can be sprinkled over food too, have already proven to be advantageous, in terms of administration. The syrup, which used to be the main alternative for paediatric patients, was met with a lot of resistance as it left a bitter aftertaste and children would often spit it out. The centre at Sion hospital will be documenting the efficacy and acceptance of the oral pellets, along with the other centres. “So far, the response has been positive. Earlier, parents would return with the syrup bottles and say it was unpalatable,” said Dr Yashwant Gabhale, head of the paediatric centre at Sion. Additionally, a decrease in side-effects has also been seen. “Problems such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been minimal, so far,” he added. There are nearly 76,000 children living with HIV in the country of which 5,000-odd are from Maharashtra. The use of oral pellets has been restricted to children up to two years of age for now. While the national programme incorporated children since 2006, it was only by late 2007 that paediatric formulations were available. Former paediatric head of Sion hospital Dr Mamata Manglani said that children were initially given adult medication till syrups came into the national programme. “However, there were logistical and storage issues with syrups that paved the way for dispensable tablets over time,” she said. Finding pharmaceutical companies to make child-friendly formulations has always been a challenge, say NACO experts, who hope to scale up once the paediatric centres present their feedback and there are more suppliers. “Currently, Cipla is the only company that is making oral pellet formulation. Mylan is likely to start producing it next,” said NACO’s Dr RS Gupta. He said the introduction of pellets is likely to make a big difference in adherence. “Gulping pills every day is a struggle in itself. It becomes more difficult for babies,” he said. Doctors say the overall adherence among children is more than 90%, till their parents are giving them the medicines. A parent TOI spoke to said oral pellets are undoubtedly easy to administer. “We only hope that it is regularly available and the supply is uninterrupted since there are limited manufacturers,” he said. Not too long ago, the syrup was in short supply across the country."

This is the 40th time the 85-year-old dam has reached its full capacity — it had reached the brim four times in 2004 and five times in 2005. Meanwhile, revenue authorities from Karur, Trichy, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Cuddalore have asked the people living along the banks of Cauvery, Kollidam and low-lying areas to move to safer areas and safeguard their livestock and belongings. District revenue and public works department officials have been informing the public by way of public address systems and tom-tom. People have been advised not to get into water pathways, take bath, wash their cattle or take picture or selfies near water pathways. The executive engineer of PWD (river conservation division) T P Ganesan told TOI that all precautionary measures have been taken to avert any untoward incidents due to the flow of water in Kollidam as well as Cauvery. “Out of 75 lakes in Trichy district, 74 are maintained by PWD. Of these lakes getting water from Cauvery, 42 are already filled. Within two or three weeks, the remaining water bodies will also be filled”, he further stated."

The children wore new clothes, burst crackers, disbursed sweets among their friends and had a sumptuous lunch on Saturday. While many of them have single parent, some of them are orphans and all of them belong to poor economic background, who cannot afford to celebrate the festival lavishly. Padikattugal has been supporting the HIV positive children and has been giving new clothes to the children during the occasion every year. This year the children got a chance to choose the clothes they want. Thirty six children in the age group of six to 17 were taken to a textile store in the city and they purchased the dresses of their choice. “We requested the textile store to open one hour in advance so that the children would not get stuck in the Diwali rush. Employees at the shop were kind enough to help us. Donors, who saw our post seeking help, had come forward to gift dresses to the children,” said M Kishore Kumar, founder of Padikattugal and a software engineer. “After shopping, we were taken to a venue where we celebrated the festival much in advance. We enjoyed the day,” said one child. M Kayalvizhi, coordinator of the event, said that they had kept a donation box in the textile store, where the children went for shopping. They had received good response and made use of the money to purchase clothes for 50 more children hailing from remote parts of the district. While many had bought dresses for themselves, a few could not make it. Clothes and other goods will reach them soon, she said."

The shelter home in Bareilly, which has a capacity to house 125 inmates, is home to 205 women. In the past year, 12 of them have succumbed to illness. Officials said that due to lack of adequate infrastructure and staff, it is a challenge to run the facility properly. According to deputy chief probation officer Nita Ahirwar, women inmates who died in the shelter home over the past year were between the ages of 22 and 65. “Most of them had been suffering from mental illness while some had multiple diseases, including infections at an advanced stage, malnutrition and anemia. Last year three women from Ajmer in Rajasthan were admitted here with infections at advanced stages. Two of them died within a month of being admitted,” she said. One of the inmates, who is HIV positive, was admitted here after court orders. The shelter home is divided into two parts. One is for mentally ill women while the other one is for those who are sent here after magistrate’s orders. These include women who have been abandoned by their partners after eloping from home and women rescued from human traffickers. For mentally ill persons, the facility has a capacity to house 100 inmates but currently has 150. The other section has a capacity of 25, but houses 55 at present. “In case of any ailment, inmates are provided treatment at government hospitals, which everyone knows cannot match the facilities provided at private hospitals. However, we provide them all possible treatment and medicines but it becomes very difficult to save those inmates who are admitted after they have reached an advanced stage of an illness,” Ahirwar added. Two nurses, a superintendent and two assistants are deputed at the shelter home. All the other employees are hired on a contractual basis, for which the government releases grants twice a year. “We often face difficulties since the funds are released quite late. All contractual staff including two sanitary workers, two helpers and two cooks are paid salaries once the funds are released,” Ahirwar added. Asked how they manage to keep 55 inmates while they have a capacity to house only 25 in the second section Ahirwar said, “We have a big hall there. We have beds and all other things in adequate number for the inmates. Besides, we used to send the estimate for their diet, following that government releases funds every month.” District magistrate Virendra Kumar Singh said, “Following instructions we received on Monday, five magistrates visited all shelter homes in the city. They made a thorough inspection to ensure everything was in order. We sent a report to the government on the same day.”"

The MP’s comments came a day after he visited Madarpura village in Ludhiana district, where he met 38 former drug addicts, who — according to Bittu — have quit drugs after a government campaign. Giving more information about the former drug addicts, Bittu said: “The Congress government is very serious about fighting the drug menace in the state, and we are constantly making all possible efforts to uproot this problem from Punjab. Our efforts have started showing results, and the latest example is of 38 youth from several villages of Ludhiana who have shunned drugs and are now leading a normal life. Some of them have even started working hard and are doing jobs, which has given a new lease of life for their families.” Bittu visited the families of some of the former drug addicts at Madarpura village of the district on Saturday. The family members of these former addicts thanked Bittu for his efforts. Bittu said one such former addict declared in front of the village that he never woke up before 10am when he was into drugs, and hardly did any work then, but now that he has shunned drugs, he has started working as a driver for a vegetable seller. “Now I wake up at 4am daily, go to the nearby vegetable mandi, and am happy to lead a normal life,” an elated Hardeep told the village gathering. The MP said another former drug addict Simranpreet Singh told them he felt so relaxed now, and wanted to emerge as an example for other youth to shun drugs, which he said was not a difficult task, provided one is steadfast. His octogenarian grandmother Naseeb Kaur also thanked the MP and said with her grandson shunning drugs, a few more years were added to her life. A district public relations office (DPRO) statement said sometime back, 38 youth from villages such as Jangpur, Dakha, Mullanpur, Swaddi, Madarpura, Salempur, Tibba, Abbupura, Malsian, and others, were admitted at a drug de-addiction centre. Bittu informed that these boys stayed at the drug de-addiction centre for a few days, and were now leading a normal, healthy life. He said the treatment provided to them by the government was totally free of cost. Bittu also lauded the efforts of Manjinder Singh Khaira, a resident of village Abbupura, who has adopted five such youths, ensuring they not only shun drugs, but also stay away from them forever. He informed that youth suffering from AIDS or Hepatitis C would be provided free-of-cost treatment by the state government. Later, addressing a rally at Kular village, Bittu urged everyone to stay away from drugs, and said all people should join this war against drugs. He said people should adopt drug addicts from their villages and take them to nearby drug de-addiction centres for treatment. He also warned drug smugglers to mend their ways, or face strict action. He also said the war against drugs would soon be won, as addicts themselves were coming forward to shun them. He assured all such youth that the Punjab government would see to it that they joined the mainstream and are provided employment. He added if any person wanted help in quitting drugs, they could contact his office anytime."

Dr R P Bhatia, senior medical officer (SMO), community health centre, Koom Kalan, flagged off the mobile van equipped with cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CB-NAAT) machine to detect TB patients. On Wednesday, 8 patients were tested out of which two were found positive. SMO Dr Bhatia said CB-NAAT is a molecular test, which simultaneously detects mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin drug resistance. The automated provides results within two hours. A single test from the CB-NAAT machine costs around Rs 5,000 per test, however the department will provide free of cost services to the people on the doorsteps. He said the state government is going to install 7 CB-NAAT machines to diagnose suspected and drug-resistant patients suffering from TB in Ludhiana, Patiala, Jalandhar and Amritsar in addition to one CB-NAAT machine already installed in 22 districts having excessive migrated population to control TB in high-risk areas of the state. Dr Bhatia said it is matter of serious concern that around 2 million people are suffering from TB in India those can easily infect the high-risk groups of old age people, children, diabetic and HIV patients. “As per record of health department as many as 39,218 patients were registered in public sectors and 6,704 patients were registered in private sectors in state during 2017.” Highlighting the importance of CB-NAAT machines, the SMO said it has been medically recorded that in some cases microscopic test failed to diagnose TB in affected patients where CB-NAAT machines being high-tech, are most accurate alternate of early diagnostic mechanism, thus, help in methodical treatment of patients. The mobile van had reached Ludhiana on Tuesday. The van will stay in the city for the next four days and will visit various peripheral areas to check TB patients and start their immediate treatment. The district health department has record of around 4,500 TB patients who are under treatment and every month more patients are adding to the list. Civil surgeon Parwinder Pal Singh Sidhu flagged off the van for slum areas and vehras in Sahnewal on Tuesday. On August 3 it will visit Daba, Lohara, Janta Nagar and Shimlapuri. On the last day (August 4), it will scan suspected patients in Basti Jodhewal. The prisoners in central jail will also be tested in the mobile van and their treatment will begin in the jail itself. The civil surgeon claimed that the state government has started this mobile van to cover all districts of the state to identify suspected patients suffering from TB. He said besides identification, treatment of such patients will also be ensured. District TB officer Dr Ashish Chawla said, “Our health workers have already identified some of the suspected patients on the basis of their symptoms and now when this van will visit these areas and these people will be tested on the spot. The report will come in two hours.” He said the workers would note down the details of the patients if they test positive so that they could be sent for treatment. He said in June last year, 800 new TB patients were detected in the government hospital and 641 came through private sector. The number of patients is increasing as this is an infectious disease, he added."

This takes the monthly average to four. The figure was the highest in the month of July, when 23 viscera samples tested positive. This, however, does not mean that these 49 people died of a drug overdose, as there are plenty of other reasons behind such fatalities, said experts. They said the viscera report, even if the sample tests positive for narcotics and psychotropic substances, is to be studied along with the postmortem report to corroborate the main cause. Data with the laboratory showed that 40 viscera samples tested positive for morphine (opioids), one for cocaine, two for tramadol (drug to treat pain), and six for benzodiazepines (drug to treat anxiety). As on August 1, 45 viscera cases were pending for reporting at the laboratory. Health and family welfare minister Brahm Mohindra said, “Chemical examiner laboratory does not declare the cause of death and it is done by the medical officer concerned, after taking into consideration viscera report as well as the postmortem report.” He said as a norm, viscera reports are sent to the SSPs or commissioners of police concerned, and these are then sent to the medical officer who has conducted postmortem, to declare the cause of death after taking into consideration postmortem findings as well as pathological reports. Following a spurt in suspected drug overdose deaths in recent past, Kharar laboratory was flooded with viscera samples from across Punjab. As per laboratory data, 73 viscera samples of suspected drug overdose deaths were allotted to seven analysts at the laboratory in July. In 14 such cases, the laboratory also got syringes with needles and utensils. Of the total viscera cases, 32 samples were analysed and 23 found positive for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, two for celphos (aluminium phosphide, an agricultural pesticide) and one for chorocompounds (insecticides), says the laboratory report. The list of suspected drug overdose viscera cases sent to Kharar laboratory, accessed by TOI, reveal the police have registered FIRs and daily diary reports (DDRs) in these cases under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Though most of the DDRs have been registered under Section 174 of CrPC (police to enquire and report on suicide), some FIRs have been registered for abetment of suicide, murder, causing hurt by means of poison with intent to commit an offence and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Therefore, the experts are of the view that a person who has committed suicide after having drugs cannot be said to have died of drugs. Or, if a person under the influence of drugs had gotten into a fight and died in the attack cannot be said to have died of a drug overdose. Dr P D Garg, head of the psychiatry department of Government Medical College, Amritsar, and director of Swami Vivakanand De-addiction Centre, said, “It is necessary to analyse viscera as well as postmortem to reach the conclusion about the cause of death. There are so many reasons since the drug addict is prone to suicide, homicide, and violence. A drug addict can die due to pneumonia, which is very common due to complications of heroin addiction and HIV.” Kharar laboratory records as on July 25 show that of the total 82 visceras of suspected drug overdose deaths, 36 were of people in the age group of 21-25 years, 24 in the age group of 26-30 years, eight below 20 years, and 14 above 30 years."

The bill covers ""aggravated"" forms of trafficking for forced labour, child bearing, begging and marriage and lays down stringent punishment for those found guilty. The punishment for such crimes will not be less than 10 years imprisonment and may extend to life in jail and a fine of not less than Rs 1 lakh. Repeat offenders will face jail for the rest of their life and a minimum fine of Rs 2 lakh. In a first, the bill rates offences like administration of hormones for early sexual maturity, exposing a person to life threatening illness like HIV and abetting a person to illegally migrate as ""aggravated trafficking offences"". Introducing the Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018, in Lok Sabha, Maneka said the bill provided for attachment and confiscation of illicit assets born out of trafficking crimes. The bill provides for confidentiality of victims, witnesses and complainants, time-bound trials and repatriation of victims. The law envisages setting up of a 'National Anti-Trafficking Bureau' under the home ministry to deal with all forms of human trafficking. ""This bill is not intended to harass those sex workers who are voluntarily in the profession. This is a bill that has a compassionate view of people who have been victims of sex racket,"" Maneka said. Justifying the need for the law, she said, ""When 11-year-old Tara is trafficked from her village and sold into bonded labour, beaten and burnt by her owner, how do we save her? When she is sold to marriage to a 45-year-old man and raped every day for months, how do we save her? We have no institutions, no processes to do so. And today, if we are not passing this bill, we are choosing to deny Tara and all the millions like her fundamental right to life and liberty."""

Introduced as “victim-centric” and “the first step towards a comprehensive solution to trafficking of Persons in India”, the Bill has received a mixed response from voluntary organisations, civil society activists and lawyers. The responses range from assertive support to strong criticism. “This bill is not intended to harass those sex workers who are voluntarily in the profession... This is a bill that has a compassionate view of people who have been victims of sex racket,” Women and Child Development minister Maneka Gandhi told the Lok Sabha. Recent protests and concerns raised by certain voluntary organisations include the worry that some provisions of the Bill can be misused once it becomes a law for victimising sex workers. After Gandhi replied to the various queries by MPs and the Bill was passed in Lok Sabha, Nobel peace laureate Kailash Satyarthi who has for decades worked on the issue of trafficking and child rights welcomed the passage of the Bill saying: Trafficking of innocent children, women and men is the biggest threat against humanity. The Indian Parliament has taken a strong first step to end this menace by passing anti trafficking bill 2018 in Lok Sabha.” Satyarthi went on to say that “it is a progressive legislation that seeks to provide for a comprehensive solution to trafficking of persons in India, that goes beyond its criminalisation. I call upon Rajya Sabha MPs to echo the same sentiment & extend their support for this landmark bill”. During her response to the queries by MPs, Gandhi shared that Kailash Satyarthi was one of those who was consulted when the Bill was drafted. She also mentioned the names of NGO Prayas and renowned activist Sunitha Krishnan, chief functionary of voluntary organisation Prajwala. President of Shakti Vahini and one of the members of the drafting committee of the Bill, Ravikant also welcomed the passage of the Bill and was dismissive of the apprehensions of those opposing it. He said it will be a law with many firsts and will finally bring into focus the victim protection and rehabilitation. He pointed that this Act is a big step in the journey since 2011 when India ratified the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) and its three protocols. One of the protocols is a commitment to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children. Amod Kanth from NGO said, “We look forward to get the best out of this long awaited Bill once it comes on the statute nook.” He also took on those opposing the Bill saying, “Spoke to Maneka Gandhi on behalf of Prayas and all our NGO partners who stood by her while she fought a tough battle against the narrow – visioned motivated groups.” Meanwhile, Trade Union Initiative, HAQ Centre for Child Rights, Lawyers Collective, National Network of Sex Workers, All India Network of Sex Workers are among other civil society organisations that came together to object to the passage of the Bill citing gaps that they feel need to be plugged before a law is passed. They point that the Bill is replete with problems. “Many of these problems were alluded to by Members of Parliament, who demanded that the Bill be referred to a Standing Committee in Parliament,” a statement issued by this collective of NGOs and activists reads. In a statement released a day before the monsoon session of parliament started, they warned that certain provisions can be a potential threat to “civil liberties and freedom of expression."" They claimed that the Bill criminalises electronic communication that “may lead to” trafficking. “There is no need for trafficking to have actually taken place. A mere possibility of someone getting trafficked sometime in the future is sufficient for the Police to arrest and prosecute,” they pointed. In the statement, they pointed that “contrary to claims, the Bill targets sex workers” even though on the face of it the Bill appears to have no impact on sex workers due to absence of words like “prostitution” and “sexual exploitation and abuse for a commercial purpose.” “Yet, the Bill will rely on existing Section 370 to criminalise trafficking for “any form of sexual exploitation” and be enforced in sex work settings,” it is claimed by activists. They point that ‘aggravated forms of trafficking’ under the Bill include exposure to HIV and trafficking resulting in pregnancy. This, they say, indirectly targets sex workers. “Moreover, the Bill does not repeal Immoral Traffic Prevention Act. So, sex workers will continue to be arrested and jailed,” they have stated. It was also stated that the Bill may add to bureaucratic red-tape and lack of accountability as it may lead to multiplicity of authorities looking into similar cases. For instance, the Child Welfare Committees deal with all cases related to children in need of care and protection including survivors of trafficking. However, to a question in Lok Sabha, the WCD minister was quick to reject the view that new authorities were being created. She said that only the National Anti Trafficking Bureau will be the new thing. Meanwhile, this collective of civil society groups, after the passage of the Bill in Lok Sabha, in a statement quoted the UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in persons, especially women and children and the special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences. They say that the UN special rapporteurs have expressed grave concerns saying that “its (Bill’s) focus on addressing trafficking from a criminal law perspective is not sufficiently complemented by a human-rights based and victim-centred approach, and this risks further harming already vulnerable individuals.” They then go on to hit out at those from the voluntary sector supporting the Bill in its current form saying, “We are aware that a section of NGOs and influential persons have been lobbying hard for the hurried passage of the Bill. Many of these groups were involved in drafting the Bill, which was otherwise a closed and opaque process.” They urged the members of the Rajya Sabha for insights and resilience to ensure that the Bill is examined and evaluated and not hastily passed into law. SALIENT FEATURES OF THE BILL PASSED BY LOK SABHA· “Aggravated forms of trafficking” for forced labour, child bearing, begging and marriage to be punished severely. · Punishment for such crimes will not be less than 10 years imprisonment and may extend to life in jail. · Repeat offenders will face jail for the rest of their life and a minimum fine of Rs 2 lakh. · Administration of hormones for early sexual maturity, exposing a person to life threatening illness like HIV and abetting a person to illegally migrate is as “aggravated trafficking offences”. · Provides for attachment and confiscation of illicit assets created out of trafficking crimes. · Imposes heavy fines and freezing of bank accounts of perpetrators. · Bill lays down provisions for confidentiality of victims, witnesses and complainants, time-bound trials and repatriation of the victims. · “National Anti-Trafficking Bureau” — under MHA"

Undertaken by the department of gastroenterology, SGPGIMS, which is one of a few select World Health Organisation Collaborating Centres for Viral Hepatitis across the globe, the review revealed that 0.5-1% of the general Indian population carries the hepatitis C virus. Considering the current Indian population of 132 crore, the number translates into a whopping 66 lakh to 1.32 crore persons. The findings have served as the basis for formulation of the National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme, being rolled out by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on July 28, which is observed every year as the World Hepatitis Day. The ministry has already formulated the draft operational guidelines as a part of an integrated initiative for prevention and control of viral hepatitis. As per the report, “SGPGIMS undertook a systematic review of available information from published studies and from large unpublished reliable datasets, to assess the prevalence of chronic HCV infection in the Indian population. The data was analysed for quality and to assess the prevalence of overall HCV infections, and by age, sex, risk factors and place in the country.” Associate Professor, gastroenterology, SGPGI, Dr Amit Goel who conducted the review, said, “The meta-analysis included more than 300 studies representing all states and union territories except Lakshadweep”. He added that around 70% of persons tested positive for hepatitis C blood test needed treatment. Prevalence of hepatitis C in the high-risk groups such as persons living with HIV, those suffering with diseases such as haemophilia, thalassemia was found to be 30-40%.” Experts at SGPGI point out that over 2,500 patients of hepatitis B and C report to gastroenterology department of SGPGI annually. Specific observations indicate that 10-12% patients report in terminal stages of the disease, where treatments often do not work. This is an irony of sorts as hepatitis C, if diagnosed early, is curable with a 3-month course of available drugs. These drugs are easy to take, safe and also very cheap. Senior faculty, gastroenterology SGPGI, Prof Rakesh Aggarwal, who is a member of the WHO’s Scientific and Technical Advisory Group on Viral Hepatitis, shared that the investment in viral hepatitis prevention and control is in public interest. “Investment in hepatitis C treatment will be paid back within seven years as the money that goes in managing the complications of the disease would be saved,” he explained. Head of surgical gastroenterology, King George's Medical University, Prof Abhijit Chandra welcomed the move stating that prevention was a must for liver diseases. ""Viruses causing hepatitis B and C nibble the liver for several years before the problem caused by them comes to light. But by this time, a simple infection develops into a disease called chronic hepatitis — the commonest cause of cirrhosis and liver cancers."" It is for this that gastroenterologists in the world emphasise on prevention of the disease. ""Immunisation has led to a 20-fold reduction in hepatitis B cases in 150 countries of the world where infants are routinely given the vaccine,” shared Prof Chandra welcoming the move."

She, however, didn’t become a victim of HIV. Fighting stigma, she groomed her self-confidence and started saving for her sons’ education. Today, her elder son, an MTech holder, works in Hyderabad, while her younger son is pursuing undergraduate engineering. Like Aishwarya, thousands of sex workers and sexual minorities have successfully kept HIV at bay and changed their lives drastically, thanks to project Avahan. The initiative focuses on integrating biological and behavioural aspects of target groups and empowering them with peer education. Avahan has been described as a “sterling example” in the recent report released by the joint UN Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS). Between 2003-12, the project, funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and University of Manitoba in Canada, reached out to 65,000 sex workers and over 25,000 sexual minorities. As per a survey, the findings of which were reported in British Medical Journal, the prevalence of HIV in Karnataka reduced from 19.6% to 10.8% and of syphilis (another sexually transmitted disease) from 5.9% to 2.4%, with the increased use of condoms. Avahan, which targeted 16 districts of Karnataka, was credited for the achievement. “We got an identity. We ensured that we protected ourselves even while in the job. I am now into counselling and am leading a better life. I was able to save money for my children’s education,” said Aishwarya, who is no longer in sex work. What made Avahan a successful model was that it never took a moral and judgemental view, says H L Mohan, managing trustee, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), who spearheaded the project. According to a Lancet report, Avahan prevented no less than six lakh HIV cases in India. Karnataka was one of the six states chosen for the project, and here, it was executed by KHPT from 2003 to 2012. The programme not only brought in mandatory condom usage but also worked for the community members’ empowerment. Clinics were set up where members went for fortnightly tests. The project also helped them save money in cooperative societies run by themselves. Drop-in centres were established at the hotspots, where sex workers could walk in at any time to relax, watch TV and consult doctors. In Bengaluru, the centres were set up in Yeshwantpur, Shivajinagar and Malleswaram and were functional 24/7. With every fortnightly visit, members of the vulnerable section understood the complexity of the situation they were in. “We set up cooperative societies run by sex workers, so that they can save money and don’t have to borrow from money lenders. We have even saved many young girls from being trafficked,” said Mohan. In 2013, when the project ended, the centres were subsumed with the government. “Avahan should have been an ongoing project to make the state HIV-free,” added Mohan. Even now, KHPT gets visitors from abroad who come to study the model that led to HIV prevention. No mean feat To win the confidence of sex workers and work with them in risk-reduction interventions wasn’t easy to begin with. Usage of condoms alone wouldn’t have worked unless we reduced their vulnerability. We had to closely work with them to understand the strategy to safeguard them from infections. We did a hotspot mapping involving them. The strategy was different for each district. While home-based prostitution was seen more in districts like Shivamogga, street-based work was more prevalent in places like Davanagere, Ballari and Bengaluru H L Mohan, managing trustee, KHPT"

The American study published in BMJ, formerly British Medical Journal, on Thursday also said that the 25-34 age group has the maximum victims of liver disease caused by alcohol. While there is no equivalent data in India, local doctors say that one in five Indians has some form of liver disease. “Non-alcoholic fatty liver is one of the biggest problems,” said liver specialist Dr Samir Shah. This could be caused by obesity or diseases such as diabetes or high cholesterol. “In western India, we see many patients with liver disease from Gujarat which is a ‘dry’ state,” he added. Liver specialist Dr Aabha Nagral said she sees seven to eight new patients with fatty liver every day. “Most corporate hospitals do health checkup and every other person in these checkups has a fatty liver.” Moreover, while liver disease is associated with obesity, doctors say there are several thin Indians with fatty livers too. “If a person with the beginning of alcohol-caused liver disease stops drinking, there is a possibility that his organ will regenerate on its own. But there is no such equivalent measure for a non-alcoholic liver disease patient,” said Dr Nagral. Not every person with a fatty liver develops liver failure though. “Around 20-30% of people with fatty liver will see the same progression as alcoholdamaged liver patients. Their liver will get scarred and there is a risk of developing cirrhosis and subsequently cancer,” said Dr Shah. The problem is pinpointing which of the 20% with fatty liver will develop cirrhosis. As many patients remain asymptomatic for years, there is a high possibility of liver failure being diagnosed too late. “Liver disease is assuming epidemic proportions in India as well. The World Health Organisation has said that deaths due to liver disease caused by hepatitis viruses is more than the deaths caused by HIV, TB and malaria together,” he said. In December 2017, Lancet medical journal carried a study that said liver disease would overtake heart disease by 2020 as the leading killer in the UK. Liver surgeon Dr Anand Khakhar’s Centre for Liver Disease and Transplantation said, “A sedentary lifestyle, increased alcohol consumption and obesity are contributing towards making India the world capital of liver diseases.”"

The apex court termed the prohibitions on acts like prostitution and homosexual relationships as one of the causes for the spread of STDs and said, ""If you licence prostitution, you control it. If you shove it under the carpet, owing to some Victorian-era morality, it will only lead to health concerns"". A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, which today reserved its verdict on pleas seeking decriminalisation of consensual gay sex, was not in agreement with the submissions of the lawyers favouring retention of section 377 in the IPC, that the homosexual relationships have led to spread of AIDS. ""The cause of sexually transmitted diseases is not sexual intercourse. But unprotected sexual intercourse. A village woman may get the disease from a husband who is a migrant worker,"" the bench said. ""This way you would want to make sexual intercourse itself a crime,"" the bench, also comprising also comprised Justices R F Nariman, A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra, asked. If prostitution is licensed then all health parameters and concerns will be met, the court said adding that when it is made illegal then such health-related issues arise. Senior advocate K Radhakrishnan, appearing for NGO 'Trust God Ministries' and lawyer Shyam George, representing some Christian organisations, submitted that the homosexuals spread STDs like HIV and the huge public funds are being spent to combat it. ""So heterosexuals do not transmit sexually transmitted diseases,"" the bench wondered. Public acceptance that people live in gay relationships will help meet health concerns and homosexuals who live in denial with no access to medical care are more in danger to contract or spread HIV,"" the bench said. At the outset, George said the courts should not add or delete words to the statute that is not expressly provided and it was the job of the legislature. ""We would not wait for the majoritarian government to enact, amend or not to enact any law to deal with violations of fundamental rights,"" the bench said and made clear that it may strike down a law if fundamental rights are infringed. George said that the section 377 of the IPC does not consider the aspect of consent and it only deals with the unnatural sexual acts which is against the ""order of the nature"". He also said that the term sexual orientation cannot be read interchangeably with the term 'sex' used in Article 14 and 15 of the Constitution, which deal with the right to equality of the citizens as there were 32-50 types of sexual orientations. ""Sexual orientation is of abstract nature and such an abstract concept cannot be read into Article 15 and moreover, the term sexual orientation has not been defined either in the Constitution or in any other statute,"" he said. The bench said its NALSA verdict recognised trans-gender as a gender besides male and female. It then questioned the authenticity of the materials provided by the lawyer in the issue of sexual orientation and said that there were several ""fake and hate"" websites and one should be careful in using such contents. It has been argued that the right to intimacy was as valid as the right to marriage, George said, adding that the European Human Rights court has held that ""the right to marry is not a conventional right"". ""If such unnatural offence as under section 377 is allowed with consent then it would have cascading effect on many other legislations,"" he said. The provision could be read as holding bestiality as an unnatural offence and sexual act with persons under 18 years of age as an offence, the bench said. Senior lawyer K Radhakrishnan opposed the pleas seeking to set aside section 377 and said that what was criminalised was the unnatural act and the provision was gender neutral. The right to privacy cannot be allowed to be an ""unruly horse"" and the sexual organs are being abused by indulging in unnatural sexual acts which were not assigned by nature, he said. The court will have to examine the extent to which the right to privacy may be extended as the persons will need to uphold the public morality while enjoying the privacy rights, the lawyer said. Lawyer H P Sharma, appearing for an intervenor, opposed the plea saying that repealing the provision would adversely affect the institution of marriage. There is no law to save the marriage if a husband wants to indulge in homosexual acts, he said, adding that the problem of homosexuality would affect Army and students living in hostels. The court reserved its verdict after lawyers concluded their arguments in the case."

For this purpose, the government will constitute a ‘Standing National Committee on Medicines’ involving scientists, doctors and experts to “review and revise” the NLEM, and may also include medical devices, disposables and consumables to the list, official sources told TOI. Only cardiac stents from medical devices were included in the NLEM in 2016, following a court order. The development assumes significance as the National List typically forms the basis of price caps extended on essential medicines by the drug prices regulator, as was done in the last revision. Also, this time round, a standing committee with a three-year term has been constituted and will meet every six months to take stock and may also incorporate changes in the essential list. With medical science evolving each day, there was a need for a committee which can take stock and have a longer tenure, the official added. NLEM was last revised in 2015 by a one-time committee formed by the health ministry. The list was expanded to 384 drugs from the existing 348, after which ceiling prices were fixed by NPPA the following year. In the last exercise, though drugs for critical illnesses like cancer, HIV and diabetes were added, many therapies were still missing. The present exercise is expected to make the list more relevant and broad-based with inputs taken from World Health Organisation and Indian Pharmacopoeia, and add drugs included in the national health programmes."

Despite the easy availability of liquor at state-run Tasmac shops and private bars, the craze for pain relievers and cough syrups is on the rise among several people particularly youth, school and college students. ""Such people, craving for finest high that liquor cannot give, go for drugs. A single gulp of a full bottle of syrup will make them feel flying. Likewise, the drugs injected also will keep them in a sedated state for a long time,"" said consultant neuro-psychiatrist Dr K Ramakrishnan of Athma Hospitals in Trichy. He said that the habit would lead to sudden death or suicide in the long run as rehabilitation could not be possible for chronic patients. The recent case was of the use of Tapentadol by four people. Not only Tapentadol but also several other schedule ‘H’ drugs are being misused by people who want to get high. Cough syrups such as Phensydyl, pentazocine, surgical sprit, aspirin tablet, alprazolam and few other drugs are also used for the purpose. Such persons won’t be bothered about using the same needle among several people in a group to inject the drug. They are prone to infections including HIV. The enquiry by ToI with police and doctors revealed that the increasing incidence of youths getting addicted to prescription drugs have become a serious issue in the city. Drug addicts and alcoholics from the district and neighbouring districts frequent deaddiction centres in Trichy. Recently, Thillai Nagar police in Trichy reprimanded an 18-year-old boy for administering himself drugs. Depression, job stress, failure in life were said to be the reasons behind people turning to this habit. Those who underwent surgeries were also prone to drug addiction as they have already experienced the comfort of pain relievers. On the other hand, former assistant director of drugs control, Trichy zone K Chandrasekaran pointed out the rampant violation in the sale of such drugs. ""The over the counter sale at medical shops, unqualified staff at pharmacies, and lending pharmacy certificates to the medical shops should be curbed. Law enforcement by the drug control department should be tightened,"" said Chandrasekaran. Trichy chapter of The Tamil Nadu Chemists and Druggists Association (TNCDA) expressed its displeasure over the violation of some of the medical shop owners. ""We keep insisting on the sale of drugs on prescription only. Most of our people comply with the rules,"" said its district president K Manoharan on Thursday. He also underlined the trend of creating fake prescriptions to get certain drugs from the pharmacies to get high."

The devices have already been installed in many government hospitals. The high court also asked the chief secretary of the state to issue necessary directions to all diagnostic centres in the state to supply a list of all expecting mothers and their due dates to the office of the chief medical officer concerned. The move aims to lower the maternal mortality ratio in Uttarakhand which stands at 201 per 1,00,000 live births. The division bench of justices Rajiv Sharma and Lok Pal Singh in the order dated June 14 stated that the CMO should ensure that the exact date of delivery of the expectant mothers is notified to him. “The CMO concerned through his subordinate officers/anganwadi centres shall remain in contact with the expectant mothers one month prior to delivery for group psychological counselling and anti-natal checking of haemoglobin, urine, albumin and sugar, malaria, HIV, blood group screening etc in all government hospitals under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA),” the bench said. “It shall be open to all the expectant mothers to send an application to the CMO concerned for making arrangements of safe delivery in the nearest government hospital, if necessary, by transporting expectant mothers to the nearest government hospital by making all the necessary arrangements including free conveyance, lodging and boarding for the expectant mothers belonging to inaccessible/ difficult areas,” the bench said.

Even on Wednesday, Bittu visited villages in Jagraon constituency to bring 14 more youngsters to the centre for treatment. Nine patients were admitted at the centre on Sunday, but they left it within two days, saying they were not given proper treatment. However, psychiatrist Vivek Goel refuted all allegations, and said he was giving them treatment, but they did not want to stay at the hospital. Dr Geeta said: “We will have to inquire and find out the actual picture behind the entire episode. Therefore, I have marked an inquiry in this case.” Earlier, Bittu also met addicts who had come back from Ludhiana Civil Hospital, and were under treatment in Mullanpur now. One of the addicts who left the Civil Hospital said they were not dealt with properly by staff at the hospital, and the doctor was also not performing his duty, so they came back. Meanwhile, the MP visited the villages of Saffipura, Malsian Bajan, and Tihara from where the youngsters were taken to Guru Nanak Hospital in Mullanpur for their treatment. The mother of a 14-year-old drug addict revealed to Bittu that her son was merely 10 years old when he was caught in the web of drug addicts. She said her husband was also an addict who left the house several years ago, and now her son was also moving in the same direction. She rued: “I and my daughter do the labour work, as my son hardly remains in his senses due to the effect of drugs.” Another drug addict shared that there was easy availability of drugs some time back, but now there was strictness in the village, so they were not getting their supplies in time. He said they wanted to get rid of this problem now. Bittu said they had brought 47 youngsters to the drug de-addiction centre in Mullanpur from various villages, and on Wednesday, they visited the villages of Jagraon from where 13 youngsters were taken for treatment to the same centre. He said youngsters from some villages had assured to support them in this task, and they would keep a watch on the movement of drug suppliers in the village, who will be handed over to the police immediately. Meanwhile, District Youth Congress president Rajiv Raja on Wednesday alleged he had taken a drug addict to the de-addiction centre at Civil Hospital for treatment at around 3pm, but despite repeated calls, psychiatrist Dr Vivek Goyal did not reach the centre.

Or is it? It is nearly 20 years since we took the first step. It was in 2001 that The Naz Foundation (India) Trust along with our counsel, The Lawyers Collective, filed a petition in the Delhi high court asking for a reading down of this law to exclude consenting adults of the same sex from its purview. The reason we did this is the law is also used to prosecute child sexual abuse (at the time there was no POCSO) and bestiality. A common question is How many gay people get prosecuted under this law? Clearly, not many but it hangs as Damocles’ sword over their heads. It is used by a highly corrupt police force to harass gay men, and the reason they can do this is because many are not out to their families and police play on these fears. This law did not allow for information on HIV prevention to be made available to the community. It’s been a long journey with many ups and downs. The one good thing is many joined us on the way, which ultimately resulted in a very progressive judgment by the Delhi high court in 2009 decriminalising homosexuality. It opened the door for many young people to be open about their sexuality. Unfortunately, there was a setback when a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court set aside the Delhi high court judgment in 2013. This came as a shock to the community because in effect it asked people to go back into the closet. This was not possible for those who took this courageous stand. This was evidenced by the present petition, which has been submitted by five wellknown gay people. There are other petitions too, including from parents of gay people. This shows me there is a definite shift in the way this law is being perceived by society and the importance of having it read down. Today, the government itself responded saying they leave it to the courts to make the decision. This is significant because they have shifted from the previous stand of opposing reading down 377. Ideally, now, the hope is the Supreme Court gives a judgment that respects the existence of the LGBTQ community. This still will not guarantee rights most citizens of the country take for granted, like the right to marry or to adopt. That’s another journey and another fight. I hope the court settles this debate so no one is criminalised based on whom they want to love and live with. Anjali Gopalan is executive director, Naz Foundation (India) Trust"

Last May, China lifted tariffs on the import of cancer drugs. But the move did not excite the Indian industry because they need licenses and tendering support from government hospitals to sell the drugs in China. This kind of support was not forthcoming until now. It is not clear if the foreign ministry is referring to the decision last May or this is a new development. Other details about the extent of tariff cuts and types of anti-cancer drugs and sources of drugs that would be affected were also not immediately available from official sources.It is possible that Beijing will encourage Indian companies to establish manufacturing of anti-cancer drugs, particularly those that are off patents, in China instead of depending on imports. China has allowed some Indian companies to establish production facilities from medicines to covering other diseases but no licence has been given to them for anticancer drug manufacturing. About 4.3 million people are diagnosed with cancer annually in China, according to a report of the state-run China Central Television. While announcing the agreement, Hua also referred to the film. ‘Dying to Survive’ is based on Lu Yong, a leukaemia patient, was himself inspired by the Oscar-winning film ‘Dallas Buyers Club’, which is also based on a reallife story of an AIDS patient called Ron Woodroof who smuggled unapproved drugs into Texas to treat himself and others. 'Dying to Survive', which was partly shot in Mumbai, opened with a massive $151 million and its total collection by Sunday stood fractionally short of $200 million, according to a popular website tracking movie business. Between 2006 and 2013, Lu helped hundreds of chronic myeloid leukemia patients buy a generic drug produced in India for around 200 yuan ($30) per month, which claims to be as effective as the foreign drug but costs more than 20,000 yuan (over $3,100) each month.

The centre is the first of its kind in the district. The centre is a part of the National Mental Health programme and will be run in association with the mental health unit here. An estimated 150 million individuals are said to have mental health issues in the country. “Under the National Mental Health programme, a district counselling centre will soon be started at PL Sharma District Hospital where patients with mental illness will be able to share their problems with counsellors. Apart from counsellors from mental health unit, counsellors appointed for other units like AIDS and tuberculosis will also be available here,” said Dr PK Bansal, superintendent-in-chief of the district hospital. The counselling centre will function once a week but the day for it is still to be decided. The mental health unit was set at the district hospital last year. Earlier, a mental health unit was available only at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College. “People do not consider disorders like anxiety as a mental disease, which eventually leads to stress, hypertension and blood pressure. Every individual who has a physical disease also goes through a mental disease side by side and it can be treated only by counselling. The district counselling centre will aim at solving problems of local people by listening to the reasons behind their anxiety and apprehensions,” said Vibha Nagar, clinical psychologist, mental health unit, PL Sharma district hospital."

The doctors treating the drug addicts at the Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) centre at civil hospital claimed that they have been treating IDUs since 2010, and they conduct blood tests of these patients at regular intervals of 6 months for keeping a tab on their diseases. If Hepatitis C is not treated properly, it can convert to liver cancer which can prove fatal. According to available data of tests being conducted at this centre, out of 416 drug addicts, 358 were found suffering from Hepatitis C in the past six months. In this way, around 86% of the addicts were found suffering from this disease. The addicts get treated in three-month course of medicine at this centre. Similarly, they are prone to get infected HIV, that can later on, lead into AIDS. Though the officials refused to give exact data on HIV+ patients, they shared that 10% of the patients are at the risk of carrying this infection because they use ‘used’ syringes. The in-charge at the OST centre Dr S S Dhir said drug addicts basically suffer from a chronic manageable relapsing disorder and in this centre, they are told to keep regular check on their health. He said they conduct the tests after every six months and do a follow-up so that the patients do not suffer from any major health issue. Dr Dhir further elaborated that drug addicts also suffer from malnutrition, sexually-transmitted diseases and seizures. “We have to deal with them sympathetically so that they get treatment,” he said. Notably, the centre is functional since August 2010 under National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), where addicts and their family members get counselling sessions and at the integrated care centre, tests are conducted on the patients. The basic purpose of this centre is to give addicts medicines orally, so that they should stay away from injections because those are more harmful."

A team of three doctors set up a street clinic near the Baptist Church every morning to tend to the poor before going to their work. ""I come here for two hours in the morning, tend to those with wounds and then go for my job at a charitable dispensary in Karol Bagh,"" said Tahir Hussein, one of the doctors who volunteers everyday. The Walled City is home to many needy, including rickshaw-pullers and rag-pickers, who spend their daily lives on streets and pavements and do not have access to proper medical care. National Doctors Day is marked today across the country to recognise the contributions of physicians to individual lives and communities. In India, it commemorates the legacy of legendary doctor and former West Bengal chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy, who was born on this day in 1882. The street clinic, run for the last few years in Chandni Chowk, put spotlight on doctors who have been engaging in philanthropic endeavours to provide healthcare and better quality of life to the poor. The facility in old Delhi is not run by any formal organisation or platform and three doctors and an army officer have come together to run this humble collective. The clinic has surgical equipment, medicine and sterilising agents to deal with varying degrees of injuries, besides treating diseases, said Premjit Singh Panesar, a member of the collective. Panesar, an army officer serving in Mathura, said, his father had started the initiative and, in every two weeks, he comes to old Delhi to check on the clinic. ""Since the poor and destitute cannot afford doctors and clinics, we bring the doctors and clinics to them, free of cost. The volunteering doctors attend to all types of cases,"" he told PTI. The Delhi Tuberculosis Association, an NGO, also offers services to people in this part of the capital city by setting up mobile testing units. ""We have vans which carry equipment and we station them in the Chandni Chowk area. Our doctors run tests for people living on footpath, for tuberculosis, diabetes and HIV (AIDS). They also give out nutritional food like eggs, along with medicine to aid the treatment. The medicine is provided by the government, we do tests for free,"" said S M Govil, Secretary General of the Association. The doctors serving with the association are volunteers, most of whom have served in the government sector and are now retired. They receive help from the government in the form of HIV testing kits and tuberculosis medication, he said. India has less than one doctor for every 1,000 population which is less than the World Health Organisation standard, according the information shared by the government in Lok Sabha in July last year. The WHO prescribes a doctor population ratio of 1:1000. Leena Sharma, a homeopathic practitioner in Nangloi, said, she treats patients for free on a daily basis. ""As doctors, it is our moral and ethical responsibility to make wellness as accessible to people as possible. Doctors make a big impact on lives of those who are sick and cannot afford treatment,"" Sharma said. The Jain Bird Hospital in Chandni Chowk treats injured birds, not only free-of-cost, but also ensures they are released back into their habitat post-treatment. ""Many people, who care for birds, bring them with different kinds of injuries to our hospital. We treat them, nurse them and then release them back into their habitats,"" said a veterinarian who works at the hospital. On an average, 50-60 birds are admitted to the hospital daily and it tends to almost an equal number of birds everyday, he said."

The submission by central government counsel Premlatha K Nair was in the form of a statement filed on behalf of the secretary of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Central government’s statement, relying on instruction from National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) assistant director MK Diwaker, said there is a “minimal risk” of infections such as HIV, HBV (Hepatitis B), and HCV (Hepatitis C) despite testing all blood units prior to transfusion due to a window period ranging from few days to few weeks during which such infections cannot be detected by laboratory testing. Use of newer technology for testing, including Nucleic Acid Test (NAT), is recommended by the ministry but it is not mandatory. Scientifically, there cannot be a zero risk blood-transfusion, the statement filed in court said. The best option is to recruit and retain a pool of healthy, voluntary blood donors, the statement noted. Central government was responding to the petition filed by Shiji, father of the nine-year-old girl who was tested positive for HIV after undergoing blood transfusion at Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) at Thiruvananthapuram. Report of the enquiry conducted by Kerala State AIDS Control Society as directed by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) of the ministry was also submitted to the court. Blood collection formalities and screening of blood or products were done at RCC as per guidelines issued by NACO and NBTC and the only possibility of HIV infection during blood transfusion is the window period. Another possibility is that the girl may already have been in the window period when she was admitted to RCC, the report said."

She said: “ I never thought I’d get married but thanks to Peter, it has actually happened. My relatives always kept away from me, and that was saddening.” Sriram has studied up to PUC and works as a guard wth a security agency in Jamakhandi town. He told TOI: “Due to the social stigma, no one came forward to look after me. Despite the challenges, I completed my education and started working.

In 2017, Andhra Pradesh reported the highest number of syphilis cases: around 5,155. For gonorrhoea, Telangana reported the highest number of cases (19,884) followed by AP in 2016; in 2017 AP recorded highest in the country.

Robotic urologist and microsurgical andrologist Dr Kammela Sridhar said, “In Telangana and AP obesity is highest in the country. Due to fat in the body, the immune system is less effective. Due to heavy sweating, particularly in AP coast, genital hygiene is affected. Tamil Nadu has worked well to bring down STDs and HIV.” However, dermatologists say figures by Union health ministry should be relooked into and could be defective.

In 8,000-10,000 patients, I get two or three cases of gonorrhoea a year. Syphilis has also drastically increased. Around 4-5 cases are reported a month. Maybe, more cases are reported in government hospitals. But the figures put out by the Centre should be revisited. HIV infections are there. Almost 65% are fungal infections like candidiasis, and viral infections like herpes simplex have increased.” In January 2018, an Osmania and Gandhi Medical College and ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, study found that multi-drug resistant strains of gonorrhoea were seen. At least 20 cases in Secunderabad and 16 in Hyderabad, verified by researchers, were found.

A workshop was organized by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) in Ahmedabad from June 18 to 22 as part of Unified Budget, Results and Accountability Framework (UBRAF) project where experts included psychiatrists from AIIMS and Punjab’s AIDS Control Society. Dr Rajesh Gopal, joint director of GSACS, said that the idea was to strengthen state-based intervention centres — two located in Surat and one in Ahmedabad — with special focus on opioid substitution treatment (OST). “A team from Gujarat had recently visited rehabilitation and intervention centres in Punjab. They shared their learning with the participants. One of the major thrust areas is community outreach and timely help,” he said. The team that visited Punjab said that the first lesson is acceptance of the issue and readiness to change the situation. The majority of addicts are in the working age group and there is overwhelming number of men addicted to natural and synthetic drugs. Experts also pointed out that instead of taking patients completely off drugs, they devise a programme that gradually decreases the dosage. Madhu Sharma, national programme officer for India, UNODC, said that they have involved all stakeholders in the fight against drugs. “The training will not only enable intervention centres to improve techniques but will also reach social workers, NGOs and families. Psychiatrists, de-addiction specialists and those implementing national and local intervention programmes participated,” she said."

Other warning signs include fatigue, fever and unexplained swelling, they said while speaking on the occasion of World Sickle Cell Day. Doctors say sickle cell anaemia, caused by a mutation in the haemoglobin-Beta gene, can bring with it a host of consequences from strokes and organ damage to vision problems and eventual blindness. Awareness needs to be created about the disease to bring down morbidity rates associated with it in the city, say doctors. “A fatal stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Sickle cell anaemia can also cause life-threatening complications like acute chest syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, organ damage, leg ulcers and gallstones. Sickle cells can also block the tiny blood vessel that are connected to one’s eyes. Over time, this can damage the retina and lead to blindness,” warned Dr Sonali Ashok Sadawarte, consultant haemato-oncologist and bone marrow transplant physician at KIMS Hospitals in Secunderabad. Doctors also point out how patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia often require recurring blood transfusions, making them at risk of contracting diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis B and C and Malaria, from unscreened blood. “There is an urgent need to create awareness on the disease and the prevention measures given that the only cure is bone marrow transplantation, in cases where the patient has managed to find a matching donor. Hence tests like carrier screening, new born screening and pre-natal diagnosis, which help in early diagnosis and prevention, should be made accessible. It is also very important to provide genetic counselling to patients before even offering them any advice to enable them to understand the disease, implications and management,” said Dr Rahul Agarwal, consultant, internal medicine at MaxCure Hospitals in Madhapur."

The National AIDS control organization (NACO), under its national AIDS control programme, categorized prisoners as one of the ‘special groups’.

In his address, Dr Ganju said the sickle cell disease should be eradicated as early as possible as over 50 lakh sufferers are leading a painful life in India. The disease is transferred from parents to child. If both are carriers of these genes, the child becomes a victim of this life-threatening disease. Constant hydration, avoiding exhaustion and improving supply of oxygen to body are therefore important for such patients, he added. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder wherein red blood cells of the patient morph and take the shape of a sickle. These misshapen cells then have trouble freely moving around the blood stream and often clot and get stuck, causing extreme pain to the patient which can lead to life-threatening condition. This disease has no cure as of today, and the only relief from it is medicines and painkillers.

These centres are becoming hubs for physical and mental torture. Inmates allege that they are beaten up and tortured by the staff. They say they are crammed in dark and dingy rooms and go through a traumatic time. With no proper scanner, the addiction treatment industry has become fairly unregulated with little oversight into the daily practices that take place at the illegal facilities, activists said. Sharing his ordeal, K Anand, an inmate from Kukatpally, said, “The inmates are treated worse than criminals at these illegal rehabilitation centres. I was not even allowed to talk to my family. I once slit my wrist thinking that this act of mine would prompt them to let me speak to my relatives. I sometimes felt it would have been better had they put me in a jail instead of a deaddiction centre.” Anand who is now waging a campaign against de-addiction centres says how most of them do not even have a qualified psychiatrist to treat addicts and they get away because of lack of effective monitoring mechanisms. Anand further explained how the inmates are beaten up with pipes, stuffed along with others into small rooms, made to clean an entire floor with a toothbrush or made to sit facing a wall without food and water for an entire day. “There are several cases where the inmates, unable to bear the torture, commit suicide,” Anand said. Another victim of such extreme torture was G Venkateshwar Rao. He was locked up in a de-addiction centre, refused food and denied even a call to his mother. He says he felt like a dead man for about eight years. For him, the battle was just not against the alleged torture in the six or seven de-addiction centres where he was shunted about, but also against an HIV infection and devastating tuberculosis blight. R Rajendra Prasad, father of a former addict, says, “Those admitted to these centres already have a problem. Why should we hurt them further? My son and many others were locked in dark rooms for days together, beaten, abused, and were kept away from their families.” He added that some of the centres have a licence for 15 or 30 beds, but they admit over 100 people.

MuHy, a kind of therapeutic agent, hits both targets.” The product is a result of a joint research NIO had conducted with the Russian St Petersburg Pasteur Institute in 2001. At the time, through a collaborative programme, Russians scientists taught their NIO counterparts how to explore the pharmaceutical potential of green mussel extracts. Russia’s coastal belt is blessed with an abundance of blue mussels, the MuHy of which was proven to have preventive and therapeutic properties in tackling influenza virus. It was this critical find that led the Russian scientists to India. Sreepada said that together they checked the efficacy of the MuHy on various viruses in India and discovered that the green mussels of Goa have anti-viral compounds just like their blue counterparts in Russia. “In Russia, MuHy has a very big market and is sold for human and animal use,” Sreepada said. Sadly, in Goa, naturally growing mussels are being plucked at a juvenile stage by fishermen owing to demand by the tourism industry thus leading to depletion of this shellfish resource in the state. “Mussels are also being impacted by habitat degradation due to various reasons. There should be steady efforts made for the large scale expansion of mussel culture in the state,” NIO director Dr Sunil Kumar Singh said. For this, he advised that Goa has to develop hatcheries for green mussel culture. This way, fish farmers can have year-round spats or seeds of mussel instead of waiting for the annual season for sustainable large scale production."

In order to streamline direct benefit transfer (DBT) where money is credited to the beneficiary’s account, the state government has sought Aadhaar card and bank account details of the patients. Dr Ramachandra Bairy, deputy director, TB control programme, health and family welfare department, said 83,000 patients in Karnataka have benefited from the scheme in 2017-18 and this year. “We aim to cover 90,000 TB patients in the current year. Once a patient is tested positive for TB, his/her Aadhaar number and bank account details are collected and updated in the system. The Rs 500 per month provided for nutritional aid directly goes to the patient. For a new case, it is given for six months which is the treatment period. For retreatment of old cases, aid is given for eight months. For those suffering from drug-resistant TB, the money is credited as long as they are under treatment,” he said. The health ministry directives mention that the state government should make special arrangements for bedridden, differently abled and senior citizens to get enrolled for Aadhaar in case if they haven’t. “If the patient hasn’t enrolled, the onus is on state governments to make sure s/ he gets enrolled within six months of the treatment period,” said Dr Bairy. On May 29, 2018, the Union ministry of Ayush issued a memorandum to all state governments on use of Aadhaar in benefit schemes and also explained how to handle exceptions. But activists working closely with HIV patients, most of whom also suffer from TB, say the monetary benefits are yet to reach them. “Aadhaar has been made mandatory everywhere, even to receive the crucial anti-retro viral therapy (ART). Tuberculosis affects many HIV patients and left with no other choice, they have given their Aadhaar card details to the government. But we are yet to hear from members about receiving Rs 500 per month as nutrition supplement,” said Chandrika, outreach worker, Milana, a family support network of people suffering from HIV/AIDS."

A division bench of the HC headed by Justice Surya Kant has issued the notice after taking cognizance of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Karanveer Thamman of Banur in Rajpura tehsil of Patiala district. Referring to some media reports, the petitioner has stated in the PIL that at least 1,630 inmates in nine central jails in Punjab have tested positive for HIV. Modern Jail, Fridkot, has the highest number of 439 HIV positive inmates, while Bathinda has 30, Ferozepur 322, Amritsar 299, Kapurthala 210, Ludhiana 137, Patiala 75, Hoshiarpur 63 and Gurdaspur 55. According to the petitioner, spread of HIV positive disease among jail inmates is caused due to sharing of syringes (used for taking drugs) and through sexual contact. The jail authorities avoid their responsibility by contending that medical examination of persons is not done before lodging them into Jails. Thus, the high incidence of HIV positive cases amongst jail inmates is taking place with connivance of jail officials, and an independent probe should be conducted by a high powered team of retired and honest police officers, advocates and retired judges, the petitioner argued. He added that such team would bring out the true reasons for spread of HIV positive cases among jail inmates. It was further argued that the measures suggested by such a team will go a long way in preventing HIV positive from spreading its wings in jails. The counsel also pleaded that conducting of medical examination and maintaining of records of such medical examination of persons before lodging them into jail, would prevent spread of this dreadful disease further, and conducting of periodical examination of jail inmates would help fixing responsibility of jail officials, if such a person (who did not test positive for HIV) is later found to be inflicted with the virus. The matter would now come up for hearing on March 12."

Every donated unit of blood is tested for diseases such as HIV and hepatitis viruses. The ones with infections are called, counselled and put through another round of HIV-testing. But in Mumbai there is a gap between numbers who test positive and those who return for counselling and treatment, said MDACS officials. In 2016-17, 0.29% of the blood from banks was positive for HIV. Given the new WHO call to put every HIV-positive person on treatment at the earliest to ensure a better quality of life, MDACS increased efforts to find HIV-positive persons and start them on treatment. It issued a circular on June 5 advising blood banks on how to take the history of blood donors and how to counsel them. Blood banks have to retest any blood unit that tests positive for HIV and call the donor for a retest and counselling session at the nearest government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC). “But in practice, such donors never return to the centres. There is a significant gap between positive sample detected and donors who return for a confirmation,"" said asenior doctor. MDACS additional project director Dr Shrikala Acharya has written that in collaboration with American Center’s for Diseases Control, India has initiated an exercise to assess reasons for this discordance. “It has also been decided that such donors should be referred to any ICTC they are comfortable to visit,"" said Dr Acharya."

Also, it is for the first time in the last 10 years, the number of HIV positive patients coming at the ART centre had dropped below 1,000.Sunil Thakur, head of the ART centre on the premises of Nashik civil hospital, said there is awareness among people due to which the number has reduced. “For the past many years, the government, health machineries are working hard to spread awareness. Lectures are being held continuously at the villages, schools and colleges,” he said.Most of the patients found living with HIV are from the lower socio-economic background and are found mainly in the age group of 20 to 24 years.Thakur said that with improved facilities at the centre a few years ago, there was a rise in number of people coming to get registered and start their treatment. However, in the fiscal year of 2017-18, only 998 new HIV patients came to the ART centre as against 1,153 in the previous year.With rising awareness about the best treatment that has been made available at the ART Centre, people are also coming at the HIV testing centres available at two hospitals, four sub-divisional hospitals, 24 rural hospitals apart from public health centres and urban health centres.Thakur said this year from March 2018 the viral load testing has also been started at the Nashik ART centre to check the gravity of the disease so that if the health of patients is not improving with the first line of treatment, the second line of treatment can be started.Meanwhile, the health machinery has even started to bring in HIV+ patients who had stopped their treatment mid-way.“The purpose was to bring the LFU (lost to follow up) patients under treatment as early as possible so that with proper treatment, their life span can be increased,” Thakur said.Medical experts at the ART centre said, “If diagnosed early and brought under treatment with proper ART treatment, HIV+ patients can live for more than 30 years. All the patients need to do is manage opportunistic infections from time to time which can be done by visiting the ART centres on a monthly basis.”For the convenience of patients, the health department has started 4 ART link centres in Manmad, Chandwad, Yeola and Niphad. A government health official said that over the years there has been a declining graph of detecting HIV+ patients. “The stigma attached to the disease is also fast vanishing, claimed medical officials,” he said.Meanwhile, the Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification test (CBNAAT) machine at the ART centre is also proving extremely helpful in accurate detection of tuberculosis among HIV positive patients as they are more vulnerable to contract TB.Over the years, the ART centre in Nashik have found approximately 15,000 HIV+ patients. Officials said the deaths were due to the concerned patients leaving hope and dropping their medication mid-way.Meanwhile, Ravindra Patil, president of Yash Foundation that works for the rehabilitation of HIV+ patients, said, “There is a possibility that a large number of patients take treatment in private hospitals. The figures of these patients are not available with the government department. If the private practitioners give their figures to the government department, the picture could be different. Still patients shy away from going to ART centre fearing that they could be noticed.”"
"237","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/62-jump-in-hiv/aids-deaths-in-mumbai-in-1-year-health-ministry/articleshow/64228799.cms",2018-05-19,"Deaths due to AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) have increased significantly in the city over the last three years, according to data available with the central health ministry’s Health Management Information System. While 27 HIV-positive people died in Mumbai in 2015-16, the number rose to 72 in 2016-17 and further to 116 in 2017-18, showed the data. “There has been a 62% increase in deaths due to the HIV/ AIDS epidemic in the last one year alone,” said RTI activist Chetan Kothari, who compiled the data. Between 2015 and 2016, the deaths rose by 166%. The HIV/AIDS epidemic, that had peaked in the nineties, has become manageable due to availability of medicines called antiretroviral treatment (ART); a fatal disease was soon transformed into achronic condition manageable with drugs. Number of deaths fell as a result even as the number of fresh HIV infections began to show a decline in the last few years. In this backdrop, the sudden spurt in deaths is worrisome, said doctors. A senior doctor, who didn’t want to be identified, said, “Deaths occur in poor patients in whom the current mode of treatment has failed.” Patients for whom the first line of ART no longer worked due to years of use, needed second- or third-line drugs. “However, these new medicines are expensive and not easily available in the governmentrun programme. The poor cannot afford to buy them,” the doctor added. However, city authorities in charge of the HIV/AIDS control programme said there is a simple explanation for the increase: A sharper public health programme that has managed to track more patients. Dr Shrikala Acharya of the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) said the organization had carried out intensive loss-to-follow-up drives as per central government directives to track patients who were lost to follow-up. “This drive helped us update the actual number of deaths. It could also be the reason for the increase in reported deaths,” she said, adding that the rise isn’t necessarily an actual increase in the number of deaths. Incidentally, the HMIS data shows that the number of AIDS deaths has been steadily decreasing across Maharashtra. From 1,426 deaths in 2015-16, the figure fell to 1,390 in the following year and further to 1,327 in 2017-18. A doctor said that HIV care has improved so much that very few deaths are recorded in the private sector, where patients pay for the latest medicine and get updated care."
